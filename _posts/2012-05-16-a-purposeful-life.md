Creating a purposeful life is easier than most would imagine. First, decide to strive for more; more for yourself and the lives of those you touch. Know you were put on this earth for a greater mission. Decide you are not going to settle for anything but the best. However, in order to receive the very best, you must believe you deserve the best from everyone. Likewise, you must lead by example.

When I was growing up, I was under the impression that if I took care of others’ needs, then I would automatically be happy and my life fulfilled. Fortunately, I realized the truth while still young enough to make significant changes.

The most important person in your life is you. If you take care of your most fundamental needs first, then, and only then, will you be able to assist others along the way. There are two major components to your fundamental needs: your mind and your body. Your mind is a muscle that needs constant stimulation to develop and grow. Take the time—everyday—to read self-empowerment books and listen to inspirational CDs rather than fill your mind with negativity from such sources as news reports and newspaper articles.

Equally as important as cultivating your mind, is nurturing your body. Commit to a weekly workout regiment. Find a routine that is right for you, whether it’s walking, running, weight lifting, etc… In turn, do not neglect your inner body. Our soils and food supply do not provide the same nourishment that our grandparents received. Our soils are depleted of minerals, while our food supply is loaded with toxins, such as pesticides and heavy metals. Feed your body the minerals and nutrition it needs. Do your due diligence to determine which nutritional program best suits your health needs and goals. Specifically, investigate body cleansing, which assists the body to flush impurities.

Besides your mind and body, pay close attention to your instincts. Trust your intuition. Intuition is one of the most valuable assets we all possess. In order for others to trust you, you first must trust yourself.

Additionally, do not try to change the world on your own. A dear friend once told me to ‘work smarter, not harder’. Discover your strengths and continue to develop and enhance those skills. Attract like-minded people into your world who will collaborate with you and assist you with co-creating your ideas. Surround yourself with positive supporters. If your circle of influence does not offer encouragement and support your endeavors, then change your circle of influence. Do not be afraid of change—and that includes the people in your life. Do not waste your time and energy on those people who take more from you, especially emotionally, than they give.

Lastly, continue to dream. Make “thinking outside the box” your way of life. Embrace the idea of expanding your horizon. Visualize daily what your life will look like. Create a “Dream Board” to put in your bedroom, your kitchen, your office or wherever you know you will see your desires and aspirations everyday. Your “Dream Board” can be any size, but should consist of words and pictures that best depict your greatest desires. The best part about creating a “Dream Board” is that you will create additional boards as your goals become fulfilled and your dreams grow larger.

A purposeful life….what does that mean to you? Only you can answer that question.
