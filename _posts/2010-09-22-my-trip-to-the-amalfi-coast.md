One of my dreams was always to take a vacation to Italy. After seeing a travel show on the Amalfi Coast on &nbsp;DirectTV&nbsp; I knew that Positano would be my first stop on my trip.

The Amalfi Coast, I learned from the &nbsp;TV show&nbsp;, is a series of small, sleepy towns built into the side of a cliff. No matter where you go you have to take stairs. Luckily, I heeded the advice of the shows host and brought my sneakers and a comfy pair of flats with me.

We flew over on Delta with a connection in Atlanta. I had shopped around online to make sure we had the best price before buying our tickets. We flew into Naples and then made our way to Positano. We decided to take the ferry transfer on the way over and we were glad we did. As the ferry gets closer to the Amalfi Coast you could see all the Cathedrals, Resorts, and Villa&#8217;s dotting the cliffs. On the way back to the airport we took a bus transfer and this was a little scary since the road is so narrow and built into the cliff. Everyone drives so fast that sometimes I have to admit I closed my eyes!

We were lucky to be able to stay at Le Sirenuse Hotel in Positano. I learned from watching the travel show on my Satellite TV that this was the best hotel for us. It is a 5 star property that you have to book way in advance. We had dinner and danced under the stars each night as we gazed over the water. It was a vacation we will not soon forget.
