Apple builds some hardware and software, but many people prefer to use their stuff for their work and research because it simply allows more productivity and is more pleasurable to work with.

Mac minis: Like the iMac G5 January 2006, the Intel iMac April 2006, and the Mac Book Pro May 2006, the new Mac mini includes Apple’s Front Row software and the Apple Remote, which gives you the ability to control the playback of movies, photos, and music without having to sit in front of a keyboard.

The minis now have Serial ATA hard drives, which offer 1.5 times the bus bandwidth of the previous ATA drives. Apple retained the single Fire-Wire 400 port but doubled the number of USB 2.0 ports on the back from two to four—a welcome addition. Earlier models were practically unusable without adding a USB hub to gain access to extra ports.

When it comes to graphics-intensive 3-D games, our tests of the Intel-native version of Unreal Tournament showed disappointing frame rates of 12.2 per second for the Core Duo and 10.4 per second for the Core Solo—compared with 14.5 and 13.9 for the 1.42GHz G4 mini and the 1.25GHz G4 mini, respectively.

The new Mac minis take a different approach to graphics than their predecessors. Last year, Apple trumpeted the ATI Radon 9200 graphics chip with 32MB of dedicated DDR memory instead of a graphics structure that borrowed its memory from the system. But in the new minis, that’s exactly what Apple uses. The mini’s integrated graphics feature is a mixed bag, though, since it adds to and subtracts from the previous graphics features.

In January 2005, Apple introduced the Mac mini as a low-cost Mac—and it still is, even though the price of admission has increased by $100. The Mac mini Core Duo’s built-in improvements and performance boost are worth the higher cost. And although the Core Solo model clearly under=performs compared with the Core Duo in almost every respect, it’s still a good entry-level Mac for the money.

As computers become an integral part of everyday life, security becomes increasingly vital. Securing your Mac is obvious, but far more important is the data that it contains.

If somebody steals your Mac they can spend a lot more time trying to gain access to the data on it. The techniques that you use to deter the casual thief will generally only take a few minutes to overcome, enough to stop someone who wanders by your desk when it is unattended but not enough to be an inconvenience to you when you are using the computer.

For home users the cost of replacing a lost computer is a much bigger issue but it is still important to consider what information the thief will have access to if they manage to get their hands on an unsecured Mac.

You need to take strict security measures all of the time as it is just as easy to leave it in a taxi or have it taken from your table when you pop to the toilet as it is to have it stolen from your home or office.
