You can improve your life and realize your full personal potential if you allow yourself to creatively transform your reality. By tapping into the process of creation, you can see your desires and goals become a reality.

Transformation

Right from the moment of birth, your life is a continual process of change and transformation. By choosing whether you want to take part in that process of change, you can transform your life and take control of your destiny. This the very nature of self improvement and you are born with the tools to make it a success.

The myths of the past were created to provide the map to this kind of personal transformation, showing that even our ancestors knew the way to find their greatest potential. The common ideals found in the myths of all cultures illustrate this ongoing archetype. On a very deep psychic level, we are all connected and need to find that internal path to harmony.

By taking a mystical viewpoint, you can accept the mysteries of life and celebrate them on a daily basis. You don&#8217;t have to follow any particular religion, or any religion at all to appreciate the sacred wonders that take place each and every day. The only limits are your own imagination and creative powers.

The Spiral Process

The path of life is an ongoing spiral that winds its way upwards towards freedom and spiritual potential. As you circle around the spiral, you can see the same challenges present themselves in your life so that you can continue to move upward.

The moment of &#8220;now&#8221; exists forever, so you can focus on your immediate existence in order to gain control over the complex choices that make up our lives.

By understanding the path of your life, you can make sense of the seeming chaos. When you free yourself from the confusion and fear in life, you can being to create a new future. If you let the infinite number of elements and choices in your life take control, you can never win over the chaos. You must actively develop a creative transformation to let your life rise up the spiral, instead of sinking downward into failure.

Let go of your negative outlook and unhealthy beliefs, and bring out your inner child who can embrace the miracle of your creative possibilities.
