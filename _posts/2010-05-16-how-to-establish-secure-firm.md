Do you have any preference as to whether to work in a small, start-up firm or a big, established, secure firm? Although the paycheck is not as appealing when you work in a small company as it does when you work in a large one, working in a small firm has its own advantages. If you ask me I would most probably take up a job offer with a small firm for the reasons mentioned below:

1. Friendly and relaxed atmosphere.
  
2. Broader job responsibilities (Chances are that when you work in a small company, you will not be asked to carry out the same old routine jobs, but will be given a variety of challenging responsibilities! Hopefully!)
  
3. Flexible work schedule.
  
4. Excellent potential for your own growth as the company grows.
  
5. Gaining of a lot of experience.
  
6. Good recognition.
  
7. Great environment for developing and implementing innovation.

And much more. It all depends on whether you want to be a small fish in a big pond or a big fish in a small pond!
