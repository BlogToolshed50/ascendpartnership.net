When it comes to Christmas, we normally put our eggs for our big family meal in the Christmas Eve basket. A few years ago our kids talked us into letting them open their presents on Christmas Eve and it&#8217;s just kind of been a habit to do that ever since then. Also, it just doesn&#8217;t feel right to open presents without being in a slight food coma either.

So in our family we normally just relax on Christmas Day and play with whatever Santa brought us that year. I also like to avoid doing much cooking so I can watch my kids enjoy all of their Christmas presents. Because of that, I went online about a week ago to try and find something that wouldn&#8217;t be to much of a hassle to fix. I spent a good bit of time looking online with our &nbsp;Clear wireless internet 4g&nbsp; to figure out what to fix and I found some fun things that still sounded like it would take a bit of work.

But then I came across a recipe for &nbsp;Christmas brunch casserole&nbsp; and I went and bought all of the ingredients for it and I think that I&#8217;m going to serve it to my family on Christmas Day.
