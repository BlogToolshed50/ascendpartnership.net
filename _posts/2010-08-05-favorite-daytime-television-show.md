This guest post from Edgardo Rosa

My favorite daytime television show is &nbsp;The Doctors&nbsp;. The show comes on at 10 in the morning on &nbsp;directtv&nbsp;. On July 27, 2010, I was pleasantly surprised to see the ever fascinating personality Dr. Ruth being interviewed and questioned by The Doctors and their audience.

Of course, we all know that Dr. Ruth is the most candid authority on sex and on sexual difficulties that can happen while being a partner in the sexual act. Today&#8217;s topic was called Sex 911 and had to do with sexual problems encountered while a woman is having sex with a male partner whose penis breaks during intercourse. Surprisingly Dr. Ruth was not allowed to give an answer but one of the Four Doctors who star on the daytime television show, gave the answer that the woman should think of her male partner&#8217;s penis as a tampon and yank it out.

That answer was, as is typical on the show, accepted as probably a solution since wishing the problem away, they said wouldn&#8217;t work.
