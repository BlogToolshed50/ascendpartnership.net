Guest post written by my buddy Royce Heath

The fall brings about many things. The changing of the leaves, cooler weather, and fall carnivals. It also brings about the countless hours of my son&#8217;s sporting events. He loves soccer. So week after week we go to soccer practice and games.

Every Saturday we set the &nbsp;security alarms systems&nbsp; and head out the door. Practice is early so we are usually running frantically to get breakfast and to the fields. Games last forever, but he loves it. I am a true soccer Mom. I load the &nbsp;SUV&nbsp; up with snacks and drinks for all the kiddos. I grab my folding chair and find myself a front row seat.

My son is really good, but then again I could be prejudiced! I hope all my effort of running him around will pay off. Up and down the fields he runs scoring goals. I jump around like a crazed fan. I yell at the referee for &#8220;bad&#8221; calls. I might embarass my little guy, but isn&#8217;t that my job as a mother?

One day when he is the next David Beckham he will thank me for all my hard work and pushing him every week to play the futball!
