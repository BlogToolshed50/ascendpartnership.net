Now that we are retired, my husband Hank and I really try to ensure that we continue to live the good life. Just the other day, I scheduled a couples massage for Hank and I. We worked hard these past 36 years, and we deserve to really take it easy and have some luxurious outings together. I made an appointment for the massage for right after our &nbsp;schedule hearing test&nbsp;. I figured it would be good to do something really enjoyable on that day since we had to be out anyway.

The massage was absolutely fantastic. Hank couldn’t have agreed more. We aren’t used to being so pampered, and it was definitely nice for a change. We also requested a &nbsp;hot stone&nbsp; massage during our session, and it was incredibly soothing. Our muscles were so warm and relaxed that we almost fell asleep on the tables. We are definitely going to go back sometime.

For our next luxurious outing, I think we are going to go on a cruise. We have always wanted to do that, and with all the time we have now, it’s definitely possible. I think that will be the next thing I schedule.
