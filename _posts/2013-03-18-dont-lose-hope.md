Life can present you with just as many successes as it does failures. On occasions, you may look back and reflect on those times when you felt like giving up. When you wanted to throw in the towel. When you felt like the light of your dreams had died. Perhaps you couldn’t reflect or sympathize with any of these thoughts, until today.

Today, I dare you to tap into who you are. I dare you to look beyond the unknown and allow your faith to guide you. I dare you to not lose hope.

I know it’s been hard for you. You’ve had to struggle. Struggle with paying the mortgage. Struggle with paying the landlord’s rent. Struggle with paying outrageous utility bills. Struggle with putting food on your table. Struggle with the grief that comes with losing a child. Struggle with the hurt and pain that comes with a difficult separation or divorce. It may have seemed like everyday that you woke up, an anthem was playing in your head entitled: Struggle. Nevertheless, you found a way to make the day meaningful. You found ,within you, a small ounce of hope.

Hope helped you to endure.

When the odds were stacked against you, you didn’t give up. Instead, you struggled, you cried, and you prayed. My friend, you didn’t lose hope.

Today, life may be difficult. Nevertheless, I pray that you will look within, encourage yourself, and not lose hope!
