What would you do when you get random emails from random companies asking you to fill a simple survey in return for a reward? What would you do when you are in a social meeting and then suddenly your friend pops up out of nowhere with his friend, you whom don&#8217;t know and hands over a survey form to you? He requests that you fill in the form and adds on that the survey is for one of the course project his friend is doing. Would you be willing to fill out the surveys?

I am the kind of a person who generally likes to fill out surveys, but I wouldn&#8217;t do that unless I get something in return. The reward should either be in the form of money or gift or some information that would help me in understanding myself better. The only exception for this is when I am required to fill out a class survey. It is for the betterment of my own class and also for the future classes. Another exception is when I get these forms from someone whom I know. I wouldn&#8217;t be able to say a no to their request.

As I say this, I am getting reminded of the surveying strategies that the companies in India use to test their concept. In big shopping plazas, there will always be some booth or the other where there are a lot of freebies + surveying forms + a huge crowd. One can always get to see a lot of people crowded around these booths waiting to fill out the surveys and get their gifts in return.

The point I am trying to make here is that any task can be accomplished in return for a small gift. Nothing is free in this world!
