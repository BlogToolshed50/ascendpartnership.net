The new teen drama that has become a main-stay of my satellite television from &nbsp;directstartv.com&nbsp; is the new 90210. Not to be confused with the 90&#8242;s hit drama &#8220;Beverly Hills 90210&#8243;, this show is a spin-off/remake of the 20 year old favorite. The new series features many of the same characters from the original, but they are now much older and some even play parents of the current stars.

This past season was particularly gripping as we saw Annie, the show&#8217;s resident goody-two-shoes struggle with running down and killing a man and then fleeing the accident scene. She then falls in love knowingly with the victim&#8217;s nephew.

Never one to disappoint in the drama department, Naomi spins a false story of sexual harassment by a teacher to get attention. She comes clean before charges are pressed, but manages to alienate her friends and on-again, off-again boyfriend, Liam. Once all have forgiven Naomi for her lies, she finds herself in a compromising late night confrontation with the teacher, who this time, takes advantage of her questionable credibility and rapes her on school property. His reason for choosing Naomi? No one will believe her! Naturally this was the season finale and I for one, can&#8217;t wait for the outcome this fall!

90210 is a great teen drama to be enjoyed not just by teens, but adults as well.
