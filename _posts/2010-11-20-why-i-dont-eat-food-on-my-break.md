I used to always eat food on my &nbsp;lunch break&nbsp; just like everyone else, but I no longer do. Not in the form of a traditional meal anyway. Rather, I might just pack down a small snack of some kind and keep trucking. I am able to do this because my hours are such that I am done with work by about 2 in the afternoon. I just eat when I get back home.

Instead, I spend my time watching my new &nbsp;TV by Direct&nbsp;. This to me is a better way to spend my time since I am usually not that hungry at lunch time anyway. If you were to attempt the same thing, you would want to make sure that you worked at a place where you were getting off early enough to make this work well for you. Otherwise you are going to end up wasting this time doing an activity that you don&#8217;t really want to do.

It is true that not everyone has the same flexibility as the hours that I have. However, many of them would still be satisfied with just having a snack for the moment, and eating later when they came back home. If that sounds like something that you would want to try, then I highly recommend it. Enjoying your home to yourself for a little while is quite the treat.
