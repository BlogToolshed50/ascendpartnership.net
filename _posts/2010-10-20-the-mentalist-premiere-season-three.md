The article written by Frances Blevins

My favorite television program, The Mentalist, had it&#8217;s season premiere September 23rd, 2010. The hour-long crime drama is entering it&#8217;s third season of production on the CBS Network. The &nbsp;Mentalist&nbsp; airs on Thursday nights at 10:00 PM, which is where I will be found watching on satellite tv from &nbsp;www.directstartv.com&nbsp;.

The program revolves around Patrick Jane (Simon Baker), who serves as a consultant for the California Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Although not legally a law enforcement officer, Jane relies on his observational skills and non-professional (though almost always dead-on) insight into human behavioral patterns. Jane gained notoriety by helping to profile a serial killer, Red John. Jane appeared on television and categorized Red John as &#8220;weak.&#8217; Infuriated, Red John murdered Jane&#8217;s wife and daughter. This led to Jane&#8217;s joining the CBI and utilizing his unusual abilities to help them solve crimes.

Senior agent for the CBI unit that employs Jane, Teresa Lisbon (Robin Tunney) often clashes with Jane, and has bailed him out of numerous disputes with the CBI higher-ups. Jane&#8217;s unorthodox methods constantly frustrate and keep her off-balance, but she almost always, in the end, has faith in him.

In the 2010 season premiere, &#8220;Red Sky at Night,&#8221; Jane, haunted by his encounter with Red John in the 2nd season finale, is seriously wanting to quit CBI. The kidnapping of a California state house lobbyist and successful attorney prompts Agent Lisbon to seek out Jane&#8217;s assistance despite his non-interest. Basically tricking him into helping, Jane calls on his unique skills to crack open the case, even though it appears to be a lost cause.
