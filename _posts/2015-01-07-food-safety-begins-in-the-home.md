More than 200 known diseases are transmitted through food, and Health Canada estimates that every year approximately two million Canadians suffer from illness caused by food-borne bacteria. While the majority of these cases are mild, Health Canada reports that 2 to 3 percent of all cases will lead to chronic health problems and as many as 30 will die from complications due to food poisoning.

Susan Brunt, a Toronto based family physician and LYSOL spokesperson, reminds us that food safety starts in the home and offers helpful hints on how to keep your home healthy this summer:

* Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water
      
* Check expiration dates on all food
      
* Bring food home from the supermarket promptly to refrigerate or freeze
      
* Thaw frozen food in the refrigerator or microwave-not on the counter
      
* Use separate cutting boards for raw meats and vegetables to avoid cross-contamination-the accidental spread of germs from food to food or from surface to food
      
* Disinfect food preparation surfaces with Sanitizing Wipes. They offer a convenient way to prevent cross-contamination in your kitchen and around the grill area
      
* Chill and refrigerate leftovers immediately and use within 2-3 days.
      
* Date leftovers to make sure you use them before they spoil 

Dr. Brunt also reminds us that the most severe cases of food poisoning tend to occur in the very old, the very young, and those with weak immune systems.
