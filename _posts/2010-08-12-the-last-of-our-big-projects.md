When we moved into my mother-in-law’s house after she passed away, there was a whole lot of remodeling that needed to be done. One of the first things that we replaced was this gray &nbsp;shag carpet&nbsp; in the living room. It not only looked atrocious, but to me it just felt too much like I was walking across an animal when I walked around barefoot.

We addressed the most noticeable things after that, like giving walls fresh coats of paint and updating the landscaping. However, we put most everything else outdoors off for a while, even though that’s what people notice the most. We also wanted to wait for some nice weather to tackle some projects like repainting the deck and &nbsp;Gazebo&nbsp;. Then we finally got around to the roof. The shingles had faded from a dark gray to a light gray unevenly. We called &nbsp;sears home in Michigan&nbsp; and got a good quote, so we decided to get them to replace our roof for us.

It was such a relief to get the last of our big home projects out of the way. Now I just have to worry about the details like painting the wicker furniture on our deck.
