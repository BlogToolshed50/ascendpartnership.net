I have been camping ever since I was just a little girl. My first memories are of my Girl Scout troop roughing it in our leader&#8217;s backyard. Though we were just steps away from a real bathroom and the television set, it really made an impact on several of us. As we got older and our families went on camping trips, four of us would always beg our parents to let the other three tag along. As a result, the four of us have been lifelong friends for over thirty years now. We have all married and have our own children now, but we don&#8217;t let that get in the way of our camping fun. Every year, we figure out a weekend that will accommodate all of our busy schedules for a group camping trip. We bring our husbands, kids, and even a tag-along friend now and again. As the weekend approaches every year, I get so excited and start packing days before we even leave. The only thing I want to worry about on the morning we leave is setting the home security alarm (&nbsp;ADT SECURITY prices Frisco&nbsp;) before we begin our annual journey. I know the others are the same way, since we are all neighbors! Some have asked us why we do this when we see each other nearly every day. The answer is simple. We want our kids to share in the same experiences that made all of us such great friends. Plus, who doesn&#8217;t like a lazy weekend that involves &nbsp;marshmallows&nbsp; roasted over a campfire?
