Guest post written by Ellen Roberts

I’ve reached that age where when my husband or grown kids ask me what I’d like for major holidays like my birthday and Christmas that I tell them I’d like some kind of renovation or addition to our home décor.

Maybe it’s because I feel like I have too much stuff at this point, including sweaters and &nbsp;picture frames&nbsp; that seem to be default gifts for moms. I love the stuff my children give me, but I think it’s so much nicer to do something to our home so I can enjoy it every day and guests can enjoy it with me.

This year for my birthday I asked for new kitchen cabinets so my kids had &nbsp;SEARS home improvement&nbsp; come and reface our old kitchen cabinets with a deep, rich mahogany color. It looks so nice, especially with the new steel &nbsp;pots and pans&nbsp; that I have hanging above the stove that they got me a few years ago for Christmas.

Once the holidays roll around this year I’ll probably ask for another addition to our kitchen so I can have it fully renovated and updated before I move onto another room of the house.
