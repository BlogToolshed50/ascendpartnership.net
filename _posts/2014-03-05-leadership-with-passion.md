Leaders tend to be people that others are attracted to. There is something about them that draws others in. They are trusted and respected and make great role models.

For great leaders this just comes naturally. For people trying to develop leadership skill this is something that must be practiced and tried and tested.

Imagine living in an environment where everything was exciting. Life just got better and better, everyone related well to each other and worked hard at home and the office.

Now imagine an environment where everything was miserable. Going to work every day was a drone, there was constant bickering at work and at home and there just seemed like there was no escape.

These two scenarios are the difference between great leadership in a work place, and a complete lack of leadership in a work place. The first scenario is obviously where everyone would like to be.

Unfortunately a lot of companies focus more on managerial skills and not enough on leadership skills. This creates a lack of drive among employees in the work place. Most people spend at minimum 37 hours a week in their office. If you work out how much time you spend at home and subtract the hours you sleep you will likely find that you spend more waking hours at work than at home. And sometimes work is the most miserable place you can think of.

If you are in a position of leadership and your working environment is like this, something needs to change. First of all, make sure you are passionate about your job. The moment people see that you are passionate their perspectives will start to shift. They won&#8217;t necessarily change overnight, but it is a start. What else you can do? Well, how about incentives for achieving goals. If you are in an office, maybe introduce casual Fridays. Maybe once a month get your team pizza for lunch.

A leader&#8217;s passion should include their employee&#8217;s well-being, and once your employees start seeing that you are passionate about improving their work space, their attitudes will change. Soon the whole office environment will be like the first scenario above. People&#8217;s attitudes from work stretch into their home life, and vice-versa. If they have a good day at work then their home life will improve. When their home life improves then their performance at work will improve.

By performing leadership with passion your team will improve, team members will get promoted, you will get promoted and the company will perform better. Everybody wins
