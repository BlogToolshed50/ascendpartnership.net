I read a great line somewhere recently that said 'We spend all our health while making money - and then have to spend all our money to regain our health."

America has 76 million baby boomers. Did you know that we are turning 50 at a rate of one every eight seconds? And did you know that a HUGE percentage of folks doing business
online today are in that age group?

Well, I don't know about you. I want to be a success in my business, but I do NOT want to be one of those harried, stressed-out executives that has no energy, a constant
headache - or worse -- a heart condition, or high blood pressure. And while we are, as a nation, taking better care of our health than ever before, there's still a long way to
go.

So in order to take care of business, I've learned how important it is to take care of ME, and I'd like to pass on a few of my secrets ...

ENERGY LEVEL

Do you often find yourself looking for a quick boost to help you get through the day? Many of us turn to a chocolate bar or a second cup of coffee, when what we really need to do is
step away from the computer, go outside and take ten deep, satisfying breaths - restoring the level of life-enhancing oxygen to our brains immediately.

If you are on a tight deadline, and really can't afford to take the time, try energizing with natural ingredients. Next time you find yourself yawning over the keyboard, try
anything rich in carbohydrates, B-complex vitamins, vitamin C or amino acids- these are all energy-boosting options.

STRESS MANAGEMENT

Everybody has stress in life, especially small business owners -- but some of us respond better to it than others. If you are a person who can channel deadlines and other
pressures into motivation, then stress will give you the extra energy and drive you need to get through tough spots.

But if you handle it poorly, stress can negatively impact your health - and therefore your business. To protect yourself from potentially harmful long-term effects, look
into relaxation techniques, or burn off some extra energy by doing regular physical exercise. You may also benefit from specific homeopathic and herbal ingredients designed to help
manage stress.

MEMORY

Healthy brain function can be affected by poor diet, lack of adequate sleep or exercise, stress, injury, illness, and excessive alcohol and sugar intake. Pay close attention to
how any of these things are affecting your ability to remember important details. If you find you need to provide additional nourishment for healthy brain function and
memory, the B vitamins and amino acids are key. Nutritional supplementation may play an important role here, too -- ginkgo biloba and cat's claw, for example, are known to
support memory and mental function.

MENTAL WELL-BEING

Your brain is the 'hard drive' of your entire body, controlling involuntary tasks such as your heartbeat, breathing, reflexes and blinking. It contains millions
of nerve cells that send and receive messages through the activity of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. To help promote mental well-being, eat a well-balanced
diet, exercise regularly, learn more ways to combat stress, and moderate your intake of alcohol and sugar.

Taking care of you will not only nourish your body, it will reward your senses - and pay business dividendsBusiness Management Articles,
