Clean Energy is get from the plants by the process of photosynthesis which converts the sunlight in to fuel. Now scientists are trying to imitate and mimic the same by resorting to the &#8220;artificial photosynthesis&#8221; to produce the clean energy. If the system succeeds than the dependence of the world on the fossil fuel will become history. The environmental pollution will keep at the minimum level if such clean energy projects are put in to practice. Various approaches are under way to ensure the success of the artificial photosynthesis in countries like USA, Japan and Australia.
