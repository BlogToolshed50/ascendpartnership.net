I am personally involved in many happening research and I see that most of the research these days are more like improvisation than groundbreaking. Why is this a scenario that is so prominent in the research world? Is it all the fundamentals have already been identified and there is nothing more to do further.

In a recent analysis, most research works are Ad-Hoc extensions of the work done previously. The basic engineering ethics suggest that one must not involve in such practices. The IEEE organization is a collaborative effort of engineers all around the world in the field of electrical and computer engineering. They organize workshops and conferences which will allow students and faculty to present they&#8217;re finding.

This organization helps in developing a community that produces genuine contribution to the field of electrical and computer engineering. They maintain the quality and thus over the years they have grown really as a very big organization.

I suggest that you to check out their websites if you want to know more information about the conferences around the world.
