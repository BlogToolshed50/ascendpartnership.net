I never understood the appeal of Educational television. I always thought that television was for entertaining and that classrooms were for educating. That is until I got satellite TV. I turned on my first educational program on the Discovery channel called Mythbusters and I couldn&#8217;t believe what I had been missing! &nbsp;Go here&nbsp; to check it out.

The thing is, Discovery channel is just as entertaining as a regular channel, but you are also learning. Mythbusters is probably still my favorite show on the channel. They take common myths or things that people wrongly believe and then put them to the test. This typically involves explosions, cars, driving too fast, and a ton of other crazy stunts.

Discovery Channel also features unique documentaries about different wars that are captivating. All of our movies are about the wars anyway, but with a fictional spin. When you learn the true meaning behind some of the events of World War 1 and World War 2 it brings it all into perspective for you. I was literally glued to my TV during a &nbsp;World War 2 documentary&nbsp; the other night. It brought tears to my eyes and I learned so much about what the people had to go through.

Educational Television is great. Don&#8217;t knock it until you give it a chance. You might just be as surprised as I was.
