The top news in the tech world today is if Google is helping with its share of environmental pollution? A new section in the Times of London focuses on how the Google searches done each day affect the environment. I could not believe the statistics which said that each google search aids in emitting 7g of carbon di-oxide. He suggested that a tea kettle emits around 15 grams of Co2.

This is clearly fascinating since we have never thought about any of these things before. I have hardly wondered about the environmental impact while I google.According to experts a single book might run around 2500 grams of carbon-dioxide in even a cheese burger might add on to 3600 grams. So is google really destroying our planet?

But as we count the number of ways google is not environment friendly, I can say that we should not shy away from the internet just because of such small unproven ideas, there are so many things that google has made it possible for the development of humanity. I think that google definitely does better job and we are not taking into the positive impact that it has on us and the community.

This is currently a very open-ended problem and I clearly see many discussions about this topic in the future and the years to come as google grows more and more each day.
