This year, I went to Mt. Hood with my husband&#8217;s family for Thanksgiving. We set the home security alarm from &nbsp;TotalAlarmSystems.com/&nbsp; and headed up the mountain. The last time that I had ever tried to ski I broke my ankle so I was determined to stay away from the slopes. Little did I know that my husband had hired me a ski instructor and had put me on the bunny slopes before we even dropped our stuff off at the cabin we were renting. I love the snow and the thought of learning how to ski was always a fun idea to me but the last attempt was such a disaster. I was scared. The ski instructor was great! She taught me the same way that she taught the littler kids, in fact, I was being taught with a group of little kids.

Although I didn&#8217;t make it to any of the adult slopes this year, perhaps next year I will be confident enough to try. I am proud to say that I learned to ski- even though I didn&#8217;t make it past the bunny slopes. The names of some of them still scare me. Names like the cobra slope and Death Valley jump. No thanks, that&#8217;s not for me. It was a fun holiday though, and the best part was that I didn&#8217;t have to go &nbsp;black&nbsp; Friday shopping with my mother.
