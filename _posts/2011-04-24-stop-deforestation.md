Deforestation has the most adverse impact on carbon em-mission according to the latest study at Australia. Thick forests serve as the sink to store the carbon and reduces the release into the atmosphere that helps reduce the global warming. It is observed that as much as 640 Tons of carbon is found in an area of an acre of thick forest. If logging is done the carbon gets released into the atmosphere and pollutes. Hence, it is a must that we should preserve the forest.
