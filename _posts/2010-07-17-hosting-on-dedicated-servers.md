For any company, irrespective of its business requires a website to present to its customers. At a small scale, individuals host websites on small shared hosting servers. The understanding of a shared server is that, you just share a potion of the server with a number of other clients. A number of web companies offer shared hosting but are not well suited for small business requirements. The biggest concern about a shared web hosting is the lack of control on how your server should be configured. The load on the server will depend on the other clients using the server resources and it is not secure either.

For host small and medium size business websites, it is best to opt for a &nbsp;dedicated web server hosting&nbsp;. This gives you the flexibility to install required applications on your server and entirely dedicate the resources of the website just for your applications. Superb.net offers a wonderful range of &nbsp;managed hosting solutions&nbsp;. A number of companies host their own rack space with servers running hard within their office. Since small issues in theÂ  maintenance of the servers can result in serious impact on your business, availing &nbsp;colocation services&nbsp; is a smart idea. These kind of services allow you to place your software in a well protected, temperature controlled environment.

Small and mid sized business hosting should really look into making a balance between cost, maintenance, performance and security and I believe that dedicated hosting is the way to go. Try www.superb.net for more information.
