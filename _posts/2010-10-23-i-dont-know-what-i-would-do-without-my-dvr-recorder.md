Out of all the items in my &nbsp;entertainment center&nbsp;, there is probably nothing that I love more than my DVR. There are many reasons why this is the case. First, I work during the evenings when all the best television shows are typically broadcast. I usually get home from work at about midnight, when there are way too many infomercials on television. The only thing I hate more than informercials are regular commercials, which brings me to the second reason I love my DVR recorder. It lets me skip right over the commercials! This means that not only do I not have to rot my brain by watching the same mind-numbing commercials over and over again, but it also saves me a tremendous amount of time. Normally a half-hour show contains about 8 minutes of commercials. If I watch 8 hours of television, that means that I&#8217;ve watched about 64 minutes of commercials. That is way too much, in my opinion.

The final reason that I love my DVR recorder is that I recently upgraded to satellite TV from &nbsp;www.tvbydirect.com/directv-deals.html&nbsp;, which means that I have so many more channels and television programs to choose from. My DVR recorder gives me suggestions and will let me record multiple shows, even if they are shown at the same time. I really don&#8217;t know what I would do without my DVR recorder.
