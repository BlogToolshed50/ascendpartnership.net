Even though I&#8217;m a 20 something year old woman, I still prefer to read young adult books. They&#8217;re just so easy to read on a random afternoon and I really do love teh subjects of them. If anything, they just let me escape a little bit from all my adult responsibilities as a teacher and get a little taste of maybe where my high school students are coming from and all the pop culture that they&#8217;re consuming.

I was on teh internet the other night trying to find some new young adult titles out that I could check out from the library and looking at the blogs from some of my favorite YA authors when I saw some &nbsp;clear wireless internet reviews&nbsp; and read through them. I had been meaning to shop around for another internet company, so that definitely made my job easier in regards to that.

I ended up learning that the &nbsp;Sweet Valley author&nbsp; is releasing some more books in the series, except the characters in teh books are in their 20s, so I think it&#8217;s going to be a really neat treat for people my age.
