One of the best aspects of the internet is using it for homework help. If I&#8217;m working on a tricky chemistry problem, a tough history essay, or a crafty poem, I can fire up my internet connection (which I access through &nbsp;clear internet&nbsp;) to find the necessary facts or gather inspiration.

Sometimes, it&#8217;s as easy as Googling my topic, and up comes tons of info that I can use for my papers and projects. Be careful, however, as not all websites are created equally. Trust .edu and .gov sites more than some random .com site until you can trust it.

One great resource is Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia edited by thousands of users around the world. Wikipedia is a great site to find general information on almost any major topic out there, from Greek history to contemporary &nbsp;Greek Food&nbsp; and everything in between. Users should be careful, though, not to rely on it too much, because the information is not quality-checked by experts. I don&#8217;t cite Wiki in my papers, for instance, but it&#8217;s a great place to get general info as well as links to quality sources.

Another way I use the internet for my homework is going to forums and starting new threads that ask a question that I&#8217;m confused about. There are many different forums out there that are geared toward this purpose. Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m struggling with a chemistry problem &#8211; I can go to my favorite site, type in the question and my progress so far, and within minutes I receive help from the forums members. Easy!
