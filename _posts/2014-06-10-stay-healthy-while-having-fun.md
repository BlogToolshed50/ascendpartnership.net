Canadians are eager to make full use of summer&#8217;s long days, often at the expense of good health. To enjoy the season, it&#8217;s important to be prepared. Try to moderate activity on hot days and wear the proper gear to protect the body from sun damage and overheating.

During hot, humid summer months, even Canada&#8217;s top athletes will train in the cool early morning hours or after dark. Be smart when exercising or playing outdoors: don&#8217;t push it in hot, muggy weather. Harmful pollutants hang in the air on humid days, making it difficult to breathe. In these conditions, perspiration won&#8217;t evaporate efficiently, so the body can&#8217;t cool down. Opt for air-conditioned, indoor workouts whenever possible and remember to replenish fluids.

&#8220;Don&#8217;t underestimate the amount of fluids lost from perspiration on hot summer days,&#8221; says Sandra Edwards, Registered Dietitian & Sports Nutritionist. &#8220;Keep drinking to cool the body and prevent dehydration. You can supplement water with other beverages, like Brisk Lemonade, as long as they don&#8217;t contain alcohol or caffeine.&#8221; Take a rest when you need to refresh &#8211; a quick breather will help restore energy levels and keep the body cool.

If the mid-day heat is unavoidable, wear the right gear to stay cool. Protect the eyes from the potentially dangerous effects of sunlight by wearing sunglasses with UVA and UVB protection. Choose cotton clothing so the body can breathe and perspire freely, opting for light colors that reflect the sun&#8217;s hot rays. And, it&#8217;s crucial to keep the head covered on hot summer days. A vented or loose-weave hat will protect from the sun and allow air to circulate, reducing the risk of heat-related illness. And, always remember to wear sunscreen with at least SPF 15 to protect from harmful UVA and UVB rays
