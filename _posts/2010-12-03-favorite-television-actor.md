Thanks for the post from Kirk Wood

With the proliferation of reality programming dominating the air waves these days, it is nice to see a professional actor doing just that, act. My favorite television actor is Boris Kodjoe who plays the suave secret agent and caterer in the show &nbsp;Undercovers&nbsp;.&#8221; He also played on the show &#8220;Soul Food&#8221; and now is playing the lead in a show that unfortunately for me has just been cancelled. I wish that the network executives at NBC would reconsider giving the show a second chance. The program reminded me of another show about a husband and wife that was enjoyable to watch and that was &#8220;Hart To Hart.&#8221; The onscreen chemistry between Boris Kodjoe and his onscreen wife portrayed by Gu-Gu Mbatha-Raw was refreshing to watch on &nbsp;Satellite TV specials&nbsp;. A young couple that are married and actually in love who by the way, are secret agents was fun to watch every Wednesday evening. Boris is a very handsome and talented actor that oozes sex appeal without being pretentious or overwhelming. He doesn&#8217;t just stand in front of the camera striking poses, he acts. The chemistry that entire cast has with each other is nice to see and definitely adds to the storylines of this adventurous couple. If one only watches reality programming, one would get the impression that the men and women are bratty, catty and hate each other.
