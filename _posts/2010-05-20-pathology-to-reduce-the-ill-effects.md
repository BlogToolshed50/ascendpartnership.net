Pathology is the science that deals with the pathogens. It centers around the bacteria, fungus and the like. Pathogens are responsible for infection in the plants and human being. In the field of agriculture they at times play havoc destroying the crop. Pesticides are used to eradicate them and to prevent their occurrence.
