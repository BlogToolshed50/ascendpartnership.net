To know that one has a divine right to live in abundance means that one has a respect for nature&#8217;s supply. Usually those who have become abundance conscious are also environmentally conscious. With respect to nature, many who have aligned themselves with universal laws strive to incorporate every aspect of their lives with abundance principles and concepts.

Consequently, as we become more conscious, we understand that money is a seed and in many ways we are responsible for where we plant our seeds. It is only wise to search for investment options that reinforce our beliefs and lifestyle.

Environmentally sound investments are more available this century than ever before. Such investments are known as Social Funds. Social Funds made its debut on Wall Street in the 1970&#8242;s and has been soaring ever since. Years ago there was concern with these funds ability to be profitable. But with growing technological advancements and an ever increasing interest in the age of spiritual and environmental consciousness, socially conscious investing has proven to be not only profitable, but consciously probable.

From investing in solar panels to buying fuel efficient cars, living a green lifestyle has never been more attractive. Due to increasing popularity with becoming environmentally conscious, one is not labeled as a weird tree hugger with too much time on their hands. Instead, taking care of Mother Earth has been championed by influential celebrities, well respected politicians, and altruistic business leaders.

With the flow of wealth and consciousness beginning to take root and manifest in many, there has been a growing concern among conscious green and holistic individuals regarding the atrocities that may have been funded using their money. Individuals who once invested, through stocks and mutual funds, for example, in companies that have been responsible for damaging the earth (i.e. alcohol, tobacco) and abusing its people (cruel labor) are now conscious and aware of their prior investments. Those living a conscious, abundant, and green lifestyle are appalled that their dollars have contributed to situations that do not match their personal values.

According to The Social Investment Forum, an environmentally friendly organization made up of like minded investors, estimates that 10 percent of all investments are made with social values in mind. The forum also counts 151 socially responsible mutual funds with assets of more than $148 billion, up from $111 billion in 2001; an outstanding increase from its humble, yet highly influential beginnings.

Many who are environmentally and socially conscious gain the greatest return on their investments knowing that their money hasn&#8217;t supported or had any type of horrid effect on nature, its people, and the community at large. These types of investors have seen the bigger picture and realize that the end results yield the highest return.

But still there are those individuals who don&#8217;t quite yet feel comfortable trading their conventional stocks for socially conscious funds. One shouldn&#8217;t beat themselves up. Start slowly. Begin to use the profits of conventional investing to further your socially conscious agenda. Use the funds to reinvest in your causes by:

1. Becoming a &#8220;Green&#8221; Angel Investor. By supporting start-up/ environmentally conscious organizations, in time nature and its people will begin to feel the positive trickle effects of these worthwhile efforts.

2. Independently invest in organizations that advocate social change. Become involved and rally around organizations which lobby and challenge congress to create &#8220;greener&#8221; laws.

3. Diversify your investment portfolio by having more Social Funds than Conventional Funds.

Spirituality and morally, if you take care of nature, nature will in turn take care of you. It is never too late to discover spiritual and universal laws that will guide you into creating the life that one desires. Trust in and align yourself with the Laws of Nature and you will soon see that living green will yield much green, spiritually and financially.
