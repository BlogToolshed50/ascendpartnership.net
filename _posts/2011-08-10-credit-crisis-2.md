Credit crisis is deteriorating the economic scenario in the globe. Reports on bank failure has become an every day affair. Bankruptcy of the banks is being observed in various countries. The regulator of the nation too finds it difficult to bail out such banks and financial institutions. The loss reported by them, are running in to billions. Rejuvenating them to become a costly effort which drains the exchequer of the nation. This ultimately affects the lending prospects of the banks resulting in the slowing of the economy that we are confronting in almost all the nations. The liquidity crunch too puts them in hot-spot creating the credit crisis in the nation.
