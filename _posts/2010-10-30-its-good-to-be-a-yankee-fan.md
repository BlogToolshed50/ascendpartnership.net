I appreciate the guest post, Vito Rivers

Watching Major League Baseball over the years have been very, very good to a &nbsp;Yankee fan&nbsp;. As your owner with the deep pockets spends hundreds of millions on players and rented superstars, every year you are in contention. Every year there are new great Yankees to add to the mix. It is almost dull in a way, like watching a movie where you know the good guys are going to win every single time. The thing is, only a jerk roots for the villain, and winning never gets old. I don&#8217;t care if the Yankees have every single conceivable advantage in terms of media coverage, money, and fan interference ability. It doesn&#8217;t make it any less sweeter.

The Yankees have won about three dozen titles in the past and the near future and it won&#8217;t change anytime soon. While other teams keep losing their stars, we just keep piling them on. Whenever I see a good player on another team, I wonder how long it will be before he is wearing the pinstripes. Not long, I imagine. The Yankees could buy all the players in baseball with their lucrative payroll. I think they should. Then the other teams will have to field a bunch of children because every adult in the world will be an employee of the New York Yankees. I watch my team on satellite TV from &nbsp;www.tvbydirect.com/dvr-powered-by-tivo.html&nbsp; every night.
