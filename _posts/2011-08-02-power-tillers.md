Power tillers are used in the field of agriculture to undertake various activities. They are small in size when compared to that of the tractor. Cost of the power tiller is also on the lower side and even the small farmers with limited land holdings can go for it and use it effectively in the field. It is not only used for tilling the land, but also for lifting the water from the well and thrashing of the harvested crop. Many countries are encouraging small and medium farmers to go in for the power tillers to improve the cropping intensity and the productivity. In the absence of agricultural laborers in the rural areas it is a very good substitute to do various agricultural activities.
