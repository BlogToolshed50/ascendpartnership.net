Are you forever trying to accomplish things but never seeming to get them done? You know you should set some goals but you don't know how to get started? Here is an easy way for you to set goals. Each step is represented by a letter form the word GOALS. 

The GET Step 

Decide what it is you want to get. Do you want to get a new car? A degree? Better at something? Do you want to get away from it all on a vacation? Decide what it is you want to get and write it down. Make a list of all the things you’d like to do and be, a list of all the places you want to go, and the things you want to accomplish. 

The ORGANIZE Step 

Organize your plan. First develop a plan by listing every step that it will take to get you what you want. One easy way of doing this is to imagine yourself as having already attained your goal. Then “look back” and make note of all the steps it took you to get there. Don’t worry about the order yet; just list as many steps as you can think of. 

Now, organize your plan by prioritizing your list. Make a list of the order that will best accomplish your goal. For instance, if your goal is to get to Hawaii you would need to plan the dates before you make hotel reservations. You would need to have a plan for saving the money before you booked your plane.

If some of the items on your list look overwhelming, break them down into smaller pieces. If you want to write a book, break it down. Start with the table of contents. Write a chapter a month. Write four pages per day. Make each task manageable. 

The ACTION Step 

Take some action every day to move you toward your goals. Every week write down the three or four things that are most important to do to move you toward your goals and plan when to do them. Then do them. 

I often use my Weekly Prioritizing worksheet. You can too. Write down your top three priorities for the week. Next, list three actions you need to take this week to honor these priorities. The next step is the most important—list the possible distractions you will encounter and how you will eliminate them. 

For instance, if one of my priorities were to get my first book published, I would write “book” as one of my priorities. I would then list, “write chapter four before work on Tuesday.” Now, what could distract me? It could be raining Tuesday morning and then I would have to take my son to school. How will I eliminate those distractions? I could ask my husband if he will be available for school transportation or set it up with a neighbor. I could also set aside some time Tuesday night just in case. 

By looking ahead and preventing possible distractions before they occur, or by having a secondary plan just in case “plan a” doesn’t work, I will get those things done one way or another. 

The LIST Step 

Make lists as you go. List what you want. List how to get there. List the obstacles that might get in your way. List how to overcome them. List your action steps. By writing things down, you form a commitment to get them done.

And finallyFind Article, The SUCCESS Step 

Enjoy your success each time you accomplish part or all of a goal. Each small success will boost your confidence and give you the motivation to go on and finish something else.
