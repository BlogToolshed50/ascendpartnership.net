Thanks for the post, Vernon Lowe

The best decision I&#8217;ve made in my life is to volunteer at my kids&#8217; school. I get to spend all day with my kids. This, of course, alternates between the kids because they are in different grades. I don&#8217;t mind spending my days volunteering at their school, and they love having me there because I can still join them in their favorite activities.

My youngest loves the fact that I get to be there for activity day, while my oldest prefers for me to join on arts and crafts day. Thankful for me they fall on different days. Some days are even split half and half, depending on what is going on in their classrooms. I try to attend as many &nbsp;parties&nbsp; as possible and any fundraisers that they may need chaperones for.

This is a privilege for me and wouldn&#8217;t be possible without my outstanding home security alarm that I ordered from &nbsp;InHomeSecurity.net&nbsp;, that I set every day before I walk out the door. I get to spend every day with my kids and I enjoy every minute of it. I wouldn&#8217;t trade volunteering at their school for anything in the world; in a few years they will trade it for everything in the world.
