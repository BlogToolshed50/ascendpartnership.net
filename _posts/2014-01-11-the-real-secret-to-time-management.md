Most people believe that the secret to time management is doing more things in less time. This is simply not true. The secret to time management is doing fewer things!

This may sound strange, but it is still true. It is so important that I will say it once again.

The secret to time management is not doing more things in less time, it is doing fewer things.

At the beginning of each year, sit down and ask yourself the following question: “If I could do just one thing this year in my business and nothing else, and looking back at the end of the year I would say to myself, ‘What a terrific year!’ what would that one thing have to be?”

Then take it one step further. “If I could do just one more thing, and looking back at the end of the year I would say to myself, ‘This has been the most productive, profitable, and rewarding year ever!’ what would that one more thing be?”

Then do these two things and nothing else.

You will have an amazing career. You will become a business legend.

Then do the same thing in your personal life. Find the two most important things.

Do those two things and nothing else.

You will have an amazing life.

Then do the same thing with your philanthropy. Find the two most important things.

Do those two things and nothing else.

You will make an amazing contribution to humanity!

Imagine what it would be like if you get to the end of the year, and looking back . . .

You launched the most successful product in your company’s history.
  
You recruited five of the most talented people in the industry to join your team.
  
You built your dream home.
  
You found and married the partner of your dreams.
  
You took 150 orphans to Disneyland.
  
You sponsored an emergency medical team to fly to a region wracked by natural disaster.

Then imagine to yourself a life made up of 30 more years just like this one!
