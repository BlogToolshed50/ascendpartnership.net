Right at this point when most software companies want to support opensource projects. The recent acquiring of MySQL by oracle was quite some surprize and sent a wave of chill among the opensource community. The cool thing about the acquisition was that, the software remained opensource.When it comes to opensource softwares like php, python, mysql and others it is a social responsibility to the thousands of people who contributed to the code and made a brilliant effort to develop quality software. I am sure that in future aswell this trend will continue to improve the way it currently is.
