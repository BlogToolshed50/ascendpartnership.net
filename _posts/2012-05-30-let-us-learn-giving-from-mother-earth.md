Earth the great giver. What can we learn from the Earth? The world celebrates earth day in different ways. In the United States of America, it is observed on the 22nd April, while the international earth day is celebrated on the day of Vernal Equinox.

The day is observed to make all of us aware of our responsibilities towards our mother earth. The way we have been taking all that we can from the earth will one day finish all the coal and hydrocarbon from the earth. Same with all the minerals. We are extracting what all we can. The earth is our greatest friend but we earthlings behave as if we are the masters. The earth supports us in all the ways. It gives us the atmosphere to breathe, the water to drink, and food to eat. It gives us thousands of varieties of plants and it gives us the place to make our home. The earth gives its all to us without any protest. The earth gives us beyond measure.

We are the selfish ones. We want still more from what all we get. We are not happy merely watching at the great natural marvels. The ice, the great plains, the tall mountains, thousands of different animals, insects, birds, the oceans and the marine life. The earth gives us all and it should be very satisfying to us. But unfortunately most of us have forgotten the spirit of thanking. We thank our friends for the smallest favor but forget to thank the earth. We take care of ourselves, our family and our friends, but fail to care for the earth. That is very surprising but very true.

One lesson we can immediately learn from above discussion is this- if you don&#8217;t protest, you will keep on getting exploited. The second lesson &#8211; unless you act miserly, no body will respect your bigheartedness. Had the earth been miserly, we would been very careful. But since it gives in abundance, we are never bothered. The third lesson we all must learn is &#8211; the spirit of giving to make others happy. That is what the earth does. If we become as giving in our life, a lot of misery can be wiped out. But first all of us must learn to give and not to ask. That is the great message of the Mother Earth.
