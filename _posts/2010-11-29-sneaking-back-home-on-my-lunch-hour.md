Guest post written by my buddy Aldo Mays

My husband and I just bought our first home a month ago. Although buying a house was a scary endeavor, we are both very happy to have taken the plunge. Much to my approval, our new house is located only a few minutes from my workplace. This is perfect for my lunch hour. Everyday, a coworker and I go back to my place to relax and enjoy our lunch in peace and quiet.

When word got to my husband about our lunch hour trips to the house, he decided that he would schedule his own lunch breaks at the same time. Each day at noon, we meet at the house. He prepares customized sandwiches for each of us, and my coworker always brings a yummy &nbsp;dessert&nbsp;. Our satellite tv from &nbsp;DirectStarTV.com&nbsp; has finally been hooked up, so we sometimes check out the entertaining daytime programming. It is a great way for the three of us to escape our hectic jobs.

I do have to admit that it is hard for me to return to work when my lunch hour is finished, but I know that I will only be at work for a few more hours. Plus, I have the pleasure of knowing I will be returning back to my dream home after work. It is a shame that not everyone can go home on their lunch breaks.
