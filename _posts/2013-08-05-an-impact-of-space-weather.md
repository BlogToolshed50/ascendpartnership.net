The most powerful type of solar storms occurring in the space is found to affect the environment. The resultant explosion from the sunspot region releases the high energy protons coming towards the earth in a faster speed is found to affect us. The high energy protons are said to be traveling at a speed of more than four million mile per hour is altering the space weather and is found to be dangerous. The latest solar events sending radiation towards the earth are affecting us beyond the imagination and we have to confront the same and mitigate the ill effect created on earth.
