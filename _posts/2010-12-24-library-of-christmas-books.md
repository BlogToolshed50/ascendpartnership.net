Guest post written by Lydia Johnson

Having four kids can be pretty hectic, as one would guess. But somehow we&#8217;ve found a way to balance it, even with the two youngest ones being twins. It can be even more hectic around this time of the year. So I get pretty creative when it&#8217;s time to keep the kids entertained once their school break has started but it still isn&#8217;t Christmas yet.

I went online to try and come up with some more Christmas activity ideas to get them to do and spend up some of their energy. When I was doing that I came across some information about &nbsp;Boise Clear wireless internet packages&nbsp; and after I read through all of it, I signed our household up for one of them.

Well, we already have a few &nbsp;Christmas books&nbsp;, but when I was looking for stuff to occupy them I kept coming across all these Christmas books and thought I&#8217;d buy more of them so that they&#8217;ll have their own Christmas book library! I think that having a good selection of them, I&#8217;m talking like 10 or 20, not thousands, would be a nice thing.
