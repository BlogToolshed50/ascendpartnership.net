I happened to glance over todays new paper and was pleased to see the new cap that BP had finally put in place. It was a pretty nice work, I should say. What remains in mind is that, how difficult was it to put up such a cap couple of months ago. Did we improve in technology so much in 3 months?

Well I hear you saying that I am still complaining. But its a honest question by someone who is surprized by the duration it took to find relief. I also believe that this cap is just temporary and there are possibilities of having future leaks aswell. Lets wait and see what happens next.
