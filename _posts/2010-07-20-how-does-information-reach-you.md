With all the technology and the buzz around, are you curious about how information reaches you. We are not in the 1990s anymore. Though it sounds so familiar, it was 20 years back. That other day there was an earthquake right at the location of my work place and guess what did I do first. If you thought, I got up and ran out of the building, you are wrong. Myself and my colleagues were anxiously waiting the time it takes for google and twitter to report the incident. 

Life is taking a whole different route when it comes to accessing information in this modern world. If you have such technology related incidents, let me know.
