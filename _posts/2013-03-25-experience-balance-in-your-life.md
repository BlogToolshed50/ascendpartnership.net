Imagine &#8211; You walk into a beautiful lobby, filled with colorful flowers, peaceful colors and a light scent of lavender. The receptionist takes your coat, shows you to a changing room and hands you a thick terry cloth robe and slippers that you change into. You pass the sauna and steam room as you leisurely make your way to a chaise lounge close to the hot tub by the indoor pool. Someone offers you a cup of hot tea while you wait for your massage appointment. You sip your tea and listen to the quiet and then – You Wake Up!

Can you see yourself relaxing like this? Maybe not! We all have such hectic and stressful lives these days that even imagining taking time for ourselves kicks the guilt trip into gear. With obligations to children, spouse, work and family, taking time out for you probably seems like a luxury for another life.

But the truth is, you need to take care of yourself before you can really do your best taking care of others. By taking care of yourself first, you create an internal balance allowing you to create more space to help others. Nurture yourself first so you know how to nurture others.

This is not selfishness. On the contrary, it is ensuring that you bring balance to your life so that you are able to more effectively share yourself and include everything you want as a fulfilled human being.

There are three aspects to nurture for balance:

Emotional/Mental: Your emotional and mental well-being is critical before you can help others. Feeling good about yourself, is important and necessary to helping others without draining yourself at the same time. Taking a mental break, relaxing and having fun will increase the joy in your life. Consider investing in your appearance with a new outfit or a new hairstyle, which can provide the type of nurturing that often leads to increased self-confidence.

Physical: Provide your body with the nutrition it needs to function properly. If you know you’re not getting the nutrients you need, consider researching supplements to determine if they can assist you in maintaining your health. Taking time to relax and enjoy your food will contribute towards a more healthy digestive process. A healthy body also requires fitting physical activity into your schedule. Listening to music while walking the dog, gardening or doing chores, will help you relax while you burn calories at the same time. Just make sure you do something every day and that it’s relaxing for you. And remember, small steps add up to big ones.

Spiritual: Developing and nurturing your connection with source provides your soul with nourishment and supports the other two aspects of a balanced life. Whether meditating, praying or attending church services, spiritual self-care helps you to find or reaffirm your purpose and keeps you in touch with your values. Take time to relax and be grateful for the many wonderful things in your life.

Nurture these three aspects of your life and invest in your well being so that you can continue to support others with a loving heart. Be kind to yourself so you can be kind to others. Whether it’s an hour to get your hair done, yoga or meditation class, a long hot bath with no kids knocking at the door, taking the time you need to refresh yourself is worth it. By being more balanced, emotionally/mentally, physically and spiritually, not only will you benefit, but also so will those you love.
