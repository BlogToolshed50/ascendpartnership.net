When we are exploiting the nature for our needs in the matter of energy, the recent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has become a threat to the human and animal life. The estimated leakage is predicted to be around 20000 to 25000 barrels per day as against the initial estimate of 1000 barrel per day. The leading specialists in the oil field safety like Mike Miller of safety doss company opined that this oil spill is to remain as the biggest history.

It is a solace to learn that oil released in conditions similar to those found in the Gulf now would evaporate that between 50 percent and 60 percent of the oil would remain in or on the water, and the rest would be dispersed in the ocean reducing the risk to the sea born animals. The oil plumes in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, including the one large as 10 miles (16 km) long, three miles (4.8 km) wide and 300 feet (91 m) thick in spots has been identified showing the magnitude of the problem.

It is estimated that the oil spill has covered about 3,850 sq Km as on April 30th and it is likely to cover more areas shortly. Many sea turtle were found dead when the spill approached the Delta National Wild Life Refuge and the Breton national Wildlife Refuge. Unless the technology is improved to avert such disasters in the days to come, any exploration in our quest to get the needed energy will have its own adverse impact.
