Usually I would not be an advocate for telling anyone how to set up any part of their lives, but this one is something that I can get behind. I mean after all who wouldn&#8217;t want to come home and watch some &nbsp;DIRECT TV satellite&nbsp; like I do?

In order to make this happen, I make sure that I take my lunch hour at a specific time when the traffic is not as bad. By doing it this way, I am able to avoid all of that mess and shoot home as quickly as possible. This means that I do not have to worry about wasting any of my time stuck in traffic. Also, I make sure to pick up some food at a fast food joint that is right on the way to my home. Surprisingly, I actually park the car and go inside. I am always able to get faster service by doing it this way. That is a trick that took me some time to learn.

Once I have the food I zip home and unlock that door. Finally, I am able to sit back on my comfortable coach and enjoy the day. It is a nice way to break up the day at work. I am not sure I could handle taking on a full work day without this little &nbsp;daily break&nbsp;.
