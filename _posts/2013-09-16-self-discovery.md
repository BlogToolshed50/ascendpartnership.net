There are millions of subjects to write about, picking one of them is easy. I like to pick a subject that is interesting and also has a chance of helping some reader get through an otherwise boring day. My favorite subject is about relationships, everybody is involved in one, so my audience is large. I can easily write about the conventional side of life, but that is being done by everybody else. So I chose to write about relationships that are unconventional. Now that I am retired and live alone I have plenty of time to go back into the past and pick out those relationships that not only were interesting, but also had a humorous side to them.

I always was a loner, even while being married. Many times I took long walks along the beach watching the waves break and digging my feet into the warm sand, I had the seagulls as company and that was enough. My radio was handy and I often plugged into the great sounds of that time. My wife was also a loner and a wonderful understanding woman. Life can be beautiful and it was for me.

Besides my wife and son I was not involved with many people. I spent a lot of my spare time observing how people go about their lives and how they think. It shocked me to find that most of them were hypocrites and also dishonest to themselves. What they all had in common was a core of selfishness that was very apparent. It was in them that I discovered humor, and it gave me the material to use in my present articles.

People that are retired have all the time they need to catch up on the things they missed. With so few years left they donâ€™t want to waste a moment. It has become a time for self-discovery. You might find within yourself the child you left behind, and it is a time for reunion. Together life can become more beautiful than ever.
