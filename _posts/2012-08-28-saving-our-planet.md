Have you noticed the pace of our lives is getting faster? I have, and our clocks are ticking. We’re enjoying the greatest material prosperity in all human history. We do more, work more, travel more, consume more, waste more, and our clocks keep ticking.

It’s true material consumption is the only way to measure prosperity, but consumption alone does not reflect a person’s quality of life. It&#8217;s true progress should consist of an increase in human happiness and not just material wealth. So, how can we reduce our consumption while enhancing our quality of life? We each should do something to help improve our environment, because our clocks are ticking.

What about our Industries? Most of them, at the present time, use the manufacturing process of a linear model that consists of raw materials being the input for the process to create a product. The by products and waste are generated and disposed of, just thrown away. But industries could manufacture products using fewer natural resources. There is an excellent model to use and that&#8217;s Nature itself.

Natural systems are sustainable. They’ve been around longer than we have. In natural systems, there is one called the circular manufacturing system. It&#8217;s based on recycling where the waste from a process becomes the raw material for the input of that same process or other processes.

What about our petroleum? It’s not just used for producing our energy, oil and gas. There are many products derived from petroleum and there seems to be little reason why these products, virtually all appliances, and other products can’t be recycled, given the right technology.

There are already several companies that produce carpets with
  
materials that have been retrieved from the consumer once the carpet is worn out, and these materials are then recycled to create new carpeting.Some automobile manufacturers are planning cars that can be
  
disassembled and recycled into new cars. Just about everything can be used again, so instead of throwing it in the trash, find out who could use it or recycle it, because our clocks are ticking.

Today humanity faces a challenge more important than any previous one and that’s sustainability. Attaining sustainability is a large and complex process, and every citizen, industry and government needs to cooperate and the governments of all nations should work together. We cannot wait much longer to reduce our impact on the planet. If we delay, the damage may be permanent.

Small groups of thoughtful committed people can accomplish a lot, but many of the changes needed in order to attain sustainable solutions require policymakers to usher them through.We can help by attending public hearings, writing letters and making phone calls to policy makers, who really seem to receive little input from the public, but sometimes a simple letter or phone call can make a difference.

By educating others about ways to help save our planet, everyone of us can make a difference, and influence large numbers of people. It’s important to get our children and their schools involved too. Children will gladly do their part and enjoy it, if we show them our appreciation for their work.

The clock is ticking and the choice is ours, yours and mine. We can stay with business as usual and preside over an economy that continues to destroy it’s natural support system until it destroys itself, or be the generation that changes direction.
