My favorite fall activity definitely has to be raking leaves. My kids and I always look forward to the time of year when enough of the leaves have fallen that we can gather up our rakes and trash bags, and push together big, crunchy piles of leaves. This year, we decided that not only would we rake our own leaves, but that we were also going to help out several of our neighbors along the block.

We armed ourselves with rakes, pushbrooms, and trash bags, set the home security alarm from &nbsp;HomeAlarmexpert.com&nbsp;, and made our way down the block. We decided that my two oldest kids would start with our next-door neighbor&#8217;s house, while my youngest and I would head to our elderly neighbor who lives directly across the street.

First, we knocked on her door just to let her know what she was doing. We were ready to get to work, but Ms. McCarthy invited us in to have a cup of hot &nbsp;cocoa&nbsp; first &#8211; she&#8217;s definitely one of the sweetest neighbors on the block!

After sipping on a delicious drink, we went back outside and began to rake up the leaves and bag them up. She has several large trees in her yard, so it took nearly two hours! Satisfied with our work, we decided to head back home and prepare for tomorrow&#8217;s raking.
