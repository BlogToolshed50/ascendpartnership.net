This New Year&#8217;s Eve is going to be really different because we won&#8217;t be going to a bar to celebrate it. Instead, we&#8217;ll be going out to eat to celebrate the holiday. This was actually my husband&#8217;s idea because he felt bad about asking me to go to a bar with our friends like we normally do since I&#8217;m pregnant. I was fine with just DD-ing that night, but then I thought about the cigarette smoke that I&#8217;d be breathing second hand at the bar and decided he was right.

He actually brought up the idea to me by sending some links to restaurants that he found on our &nbsp;CLEAR 4g INTERNET&nbsp; that were having specials for the night. He also said something about how he thought that it would be a great way to start off our life as a really family in the New Year.

After he added that at the end of the e-mail, I just couldn&#8217;t turn down a nice &nbsp;New Year&#8217;s Eve dinner&nbsp; with just the two of us.
