With all the buzz around apple products, It has recently come to notice that they showed their most careless front. In the past Apples US partner was blamed for dropped calls but Iphone 4 brought with it its deep hidded secrets. Though apple officials deny any serious issue and blame a software bug for those, it seems that mobile carriers were never given enough time for testing before the product was rolled out. 

After the news about all these things broke out, apples shares dropped down by 7%. It will be interesting to see how the consumers deal with these kind of attitude by tech companies.
