My son is one of those people that will never tell you what they want for Christmas because they don√ït&#8217; want you to get them anything. And the thing is, that drives me absolutely crazy! I&#8217;m always worried that he&#8217;s never going to like what I get him, so it would really make it so much easier on me if he would just tell him something that he&#8217;d like.

Well, actually, he&#8217;s a freshman at college this year and I thought that maybe I would get him something that he could use in his dorm room. I went looking online with my &nbsp;mobile broadband&nbsp; to get some ideas and decided to get a lap desk.

Well, I ordered that. Then I got to thinking about how drafty his dorm room is, so I decided to make him a &nbsp;DIY fleece blanket&nbsp; that he could use at his computer chair or while he&#8217;s sitting on his futon watching TV. He&#8217;s so tall, so those little fleece blankets they sell aren&#8217;t long enough for him, so I cut him an extra long one that will actually fit. At least I know that I&#8217;ll use this.
