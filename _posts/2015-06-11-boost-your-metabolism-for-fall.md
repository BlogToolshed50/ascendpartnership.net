A balanced approach to diet and nutrition provides long-term results.

The balmy late-summer days give way to the cool breezes of autumn, many people are inspired to tackle their fitness routine with new vigor. With kids back in school, parents have more time to get to the gym, and the crisp fall air makes it possible to exercise comfortably, free of the summer heat and humidity.

Even with a fitness regimen in place, most people tend to be more sedentary in fall and winter; for that reason, it is important to incorporate a balanced approach to diet and nutrition into your plan. For example, most people don&#8217;t eat the recommended four to five servings of fruits and vegetables each day. But our health, energy, muscle development and more are all directly linked to the whole foods, vitamins and supplements we ingest each day.

As a society, we are very interested in health and fitness, and yet it seems that this heightened curiosity has become our worst enemy. We constantly fall victim to the quick fix approaches promised by many diet and exercise companies. In doing so, we misunderstand our body and how it really works.

Life Time Fitness didn&#8217;t stop there. The company also amassed a team of independent, nationally renowned physicians, biochemists, nutritionists and researchers, to help it develop a full line of Fast Fuel nutrition bars, and vitamin and mineral supplements specifically designed to help people achieve their health and fitness goals.

Instead of being blindly lead by every new diet and exercise fad, consumers finally will possess the knowledge to understand what works, what doesn&#8217;t, and why.
