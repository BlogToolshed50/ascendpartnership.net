When you seem to spend countless hours at the computer each day, it&#8217;s the little things that can add a breath of fresh air to your work environment.

There are many resources out there for finding free images to use as your desktop wallpaper&#8230;but you could spend many hours researching the subject and still not find what you&#8217;re looking for. Fortunately, someone has already invested the time finding the really cool wallpaper sites and posting the links to the best ones on a single page.

As of this writing, he has over 50 links on the page, representing thousands of free images. Really delightful stuff. Much of it defies description. As for some of the rest:

From original artwork to gorgeous photographs&#8230;from digital art creations to fractal designs&#8230;from Hubble space images to exotic cars. There are also links to pages on Flickr that are designated specifically as wallpaper categories. How about some macro photography? You know&#8230;those extremely close-up images of flowers, bugs and the like? Yep, you&#8217;ll find that here. How about wallpaper designed to stretch across your dual-monitor configuration? You got it. How about some classic pictures from those masters of the photographic image at National Geographic? It seems like there&#8217;s a little something here for everyone.

If you&#8217;ve never done it before, you&#8217;ll be pleased to find that t&#8217;s easy to swap out one of these wallpapers for your current desktop image. Download the picture to a convenient place on your hard drive. Then, assuming you&#8217;re running Windows XP, right-click on the desktop and select Properties. Then click the Desktop tab and browse to find the picture you saved. Unless your background matches your monitor&#8217;s screen resolution exactly, you&#8217;ll need to decide how to compensate for the difference. Do you want to stretch it to fit&#8230;repeat the pattern until the screen is filled&#8230;or just leave it at its original size? Try them all until you decide what works best for you.

For some people, changing their desktop picture is as mood-altering as lifting a shade and watching the room full with rays of sunshine. How will it affect you? You probably won&#8217;t know until you try. As for me, I&#8217;m going to go replace this beautiful red gas-cloud-and-stars picture I&#8217;ve been using for the past few minutes with one I downloaded from one of these links today, called “Blue Energy Tornado”.

Happy searching!
