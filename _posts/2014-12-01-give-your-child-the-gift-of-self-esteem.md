Much has been said about the &#8220;gifted child&#8221; but in truth every child is born with unlimited potential. As expressed so well by Orison Marden:

&#8220;Deep within man dwell those slumbering powers; powers that would astonish him, that he never dreamed of possessing; forces that would revolutionize his life if aroused and put into action.&#8221;

This statement can be true for your child. Not just if he&#8217;s a &#8220;gifted child&#8221; but any child. Indeed, perhaps we should consider a &#8220;gifted child&#8221; to be a child whose parents have gifted him with a high self-esteem.

Children with high self-esteem are happier and more successful. Low self-esteem is common in children who are performing badly at school, have behavioral problems and suffer from depression.

The Newborn

The &#8220;helpless&#8221; newborn baby actually comes into the world well equipped with the power to get what she wants. Not only do her cries bring her parents running to tend to her; she also uses her body and facial language to get what she wants. It&#8217;s no coincidence that babies learn to smile while they are still very small &#8211; it is an essential tool in their armory of communication. A baby with a disarming smile can frequently wrap mommy or daddy round her little finger!

At this early stage, it&#8217;s important to respond to all your baby attempts at communication. Attend to her when she cries (this does not preclude training her gently into a stable routine), mirror her attempts at facial communication and reward the infant sounds she makes by praising her and talking back to her.

The &#8220;Can-Do&#8221; Toddler

Toddlers are into everything! They are learning so fast about the world around them and want to explore everything, touch everything and even try to eat many things.

It is such a crucial stage and one that is stifled by many parents. Yes, you need to control your child&#8217;s behavior so that he doesn&#8217;t hurt himself or damage valuable property. But you also need to give him opportunities to express this exploratory behavior without constant criticism and telling-offs.

Put valuables out of reach and supply your child with toys or household items that he can play with safely. Try to find time to get down on the floor and play with your toddler. Let him watch you and imitate you. He could play on the kitchen floor with some pots and wooden spoons while you are cooking.

Discipline

I want to emphasize up front that I believe discipline is very important, because I don&#8217;t want you to think in any of what follows that I&#8217;m advocating spoiling your child. Some parents call this &#8220;allowing the child to enjoy the freedom of youth.&#8221; These parents are entitled, of course, to raise their children however they wish.

But if you want your child to grow into a successful adult, you would do better by teaching her firmly what is and isn&#8217;t acceptable in present day society. And, just as importantly, helping her to learn self-discipline and that you will support her in achieving anything she wants, as long as she does so ethically.

Discipline should be sensitive, thoughtful and appropriate. You should strive to never lose your temper but to discipline your child calmly and firmly. When is discipline appropriate? When your child&#8217;s actions (or lack of them) may harm herself or others. When is discipline not appropriate? When it is purely for the parent&#8217;s own selfish preferences.
