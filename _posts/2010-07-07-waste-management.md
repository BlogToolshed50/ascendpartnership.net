In this modern world, the technology available with us can make and mar things equally. If you look into the various materials like plastics, clothes, papers, etc., we use in our day to day life, they help us in many ways and also become dangerous in few aspects if they are not recycled properly.

As a person interested in the environmental protection, used to always wonder whether we have the right means of waste management. Most of the waste that we produce are Bio degradable. But we do not apply our minds to manage them properly so that they can be easily recycled and put in to use without affecting the environment.

In countries like Australia and Europe, much attention is given to the waste management so that the environment is protected. It is clearly proved that different types of wastes create various types of environmental problems. In the conventional methods all the waste that are produced were dumped in the dumping yard and allowed for natural degradation. But the present wastes contain lots of non degradable items that cannot be degraded by mere dumping in the yard.

It is up to the Govet authorities to devise the right method of managing the wastes so that they are degraded properly to put in to use without polluting the environment. As a responsible citizen one should try to minimize the usage of non degradable items to avoid the creation of such waste items
