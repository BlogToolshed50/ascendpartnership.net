Going to the Edgebrook Library is a very enjoyable line on my To Do List. Getting there involves driving on a long stretch of road that runs through a forested area. I get to enjoy and observe the changing of the seasons. Fall with all its vibrant color is especially pleasant.

I know that I will be out of the house for some time and want to feel that my home is secure and protected, so, the very last thing that I do before walking out the door is set my home security alarm from &nbsp;HomeAlarmExpert.com&nbsp;.

Once at the library, I return books and, or movies that are due back, and then make a quick check of my email and sometimes do a little research on their free rental computer. Chores done, I browse through the rental movie section and the fiction novel section. I often discover new authors that way. I&#8217;ll pick out a book and spend some time skimming through it to see if it is something I want to read. My library has a nice feature. It allows you to order books, put them on hold they call it, and when they are available, sends you an email or calls to say that the books are ready for pickup. I finish the trip by gathering up the books being held for me and checking them out along with any other books or movies that I have selected. Did I mention that you could put &nbsp;movies&nbsp; on hold too?
