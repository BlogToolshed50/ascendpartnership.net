“I am thought. I can see what the eyes cannot see. I can hear what the ears cannot hear. I can feel what the heart cannot feel.”
  
• Peter Nivio Zarlenga, American Businessman.

That how powerful visualization can be! It goes beyond any chains of fear or any other limits. Visualizing is daydreaming but with a purpose. There is this uncanny grandeur in knowing that in the realm of thought &#8211; you are without a chain, that you have the right to explore all heights and depth, that there are no walls nor fences, nor prohibited places, nor sacred corners in all the vast expanse of thought!

Imagine what the great achievers like scientists, athletes, etc would have done if they had not visualized their victory or if they had not believed in their dreams and worked towards them. There would have been no great achievement, no discovery, no uniqueness that would have come to light if these people had not visualized. The power of visualization is what gave them faith and courage in moving ahead to make such humongous achievements and thus becoming legends. History has proved time and again that all the peak performers mentally go through the important events or tasks even before they happen.

It is said that ideas cross mountains, borders, and seas. They go anywhere a man may not go. With visualization, your mind starts formulating ways to get closer to your goal. Visualization gives us the zeal and patience to reach the podium of victory. Visualization is indeed a creative force.

Imagine an ideal life for yourself; who would not then strive to paint such an ideal life in reality too? Get yourself accustomed to visualizing your aim. Mold your mind in believing that you can do better with each day and with each try as what you actually get is just what you see. Instead of being preoccupied with worry and concerns, daydream and visualize with an unwavering faith that whatever you dream of will come true. Visualization is what will give you strength in crossing all the hurdles in your path towards your goal, it will give you the energy to withstand any negative forces, it is the vehicle that will bring your dreams to life.

Whether you visually the negative or positive, either way you are creating. Being preoccupied in worry will for sure, bring those worries to life. So stop sabotaging yourself, creating in reverse, let visualization work for you and see yourself achieving, overcoming and succeed! What you see is what you will get!
