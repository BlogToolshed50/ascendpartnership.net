The first situation to consider is the relationship between thoughts and conditions like depression and stress. A crucial question is whether the person&#8217;s thoughts are creating the physical depression or the physical depression is creating the negative thinking. When it comes to how you can use your mind to help, this can be accomplished consciously and subconsciously. When someone has a habit of imagining things turning out very badly, rational thinking can show show them that they often exaggerate. However, the unconscious mind is much more powerful in shaping our habitual behavior, oftentimes beyond our conscious control. Visualization and hypnosis can be very effective in modifying beliefs and, if you do this, the long-lasting effects can be more powerful than using logic only. 

It is likewise true that positive thinking can have an impact on our physical health, and you may be aware of the placebo effect on people who feel ill. This is when individuals are given a pill which in reality does not have any healing value, and yet they claim to notice an improvement in how they feel. This is evidence of the connection between mind and body, and there are many examples of men and women with a positive outlook being able to recover faster from malady and injury. You can also use the power of your mind to help you in achieving your fitness goals. A historic example of this is when the four minute barrier for running the mile was broken, which had been considered as unachievable up to that point. Once the &#8220;barrier&#8221; had been broken, other runners also began to break through what had really been a barrier of belief. 

The effects of aging are likewise influenced by how we think about the process. As you get older, do you talk to your friends about your &#8220;aches and pains&#8221; and your weakened capabilities? It seems there&#8217;s a great deal of truth to the saying, &#8220;You&#8217;re only as old as you think you are,&#8221; and our thoughts can be used to undo a lot of the so-called effects of aging. Unfortunately, numerous individuals will continue to hold on to old beliefs about the unavoidable &#8220;decline&#8221; of health in old age, and not pay attention to the benefits of a positive outlook. 

Now that you are aware that your attitude can bring you a much better state of health, it&#8217;s up to you to take advantage of this information and set your intention to think positive thoughts whenever you remember.
