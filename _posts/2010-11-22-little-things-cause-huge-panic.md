Your best friend, you know the kind. The one that calls you sounding like the world is going to crash at any moment. Well, I have known my best friend since third grade in school, and love her to pieces, but sometimes, I seriously want to knock some sense into her. She calls me one day with that panicky voice, not telling me what&#8217;s wrong, that made me immediately run out the door, only to have to run back into the house to set the &nbsp;Home Alarm Systems&nbsp;, jump in the car and drive like a maniac to her front door. Only to find out that her panic was caused by a mouse. Now you see why she deserves the beating (with a pillow of course).

This was not a rat, nor was it a full grown mouse. It was just past the point of being able to walk on its own, size of mouse. I was furious, but at the same time I was laughing so hard that I was crying, over the fact that her thumb was probably three times the size of this little mouse. With her up on the counter, I scooped the &nbsp;mouse&nbsp; up into a jar. Now when she calls me in a calm voice asking, “Never guess what I did today?” I can say- “not see a mouse?”
