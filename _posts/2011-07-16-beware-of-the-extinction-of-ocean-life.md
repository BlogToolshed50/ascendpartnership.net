Though we are cautioned by various studies regarding the impact of climate change and different kinds of environmental intrusion by humans, we are still to seriously look into the matter. The latest study by the International Programme on the State of the Ocean has confirmed the necessity to counter act the various hazards like collapse of the coral reefs and the spread of the &#8220;dead zones&#8221; with low-level of oxygen. If their prediction comes true than the extinction of life in the ocean in millions of years is not ruled out.

The over exploitation of the natural resources, creation of pollution beyond the thresh hold limit is bound to cause combined effect to accelerate the extinction of the ocean life according to their study. It is high time that we realize the importance of the same and take appropriate action to avoid the possible extinction. The abnormal uses of fossil fuel is heating the planet leading to the acidification of the ocean killing the marine living creatures. Use of renewable energy like solar and wind and reducing the dependence on the fossil fuel may reduce the global warming and protect the ocean life.
