Your dreams help you in so many ways, showing you so many things that you really have to learn how to translate them according to the scientific method.

You don&#8217;t need to write them down regularly if you don&#8217;t wish to, even though this is recommended.

At least, learn how to translate the intriguing dreams that will make you wonder about their meaning. Usually these are the most important ones.

Many times a single, small dream can reveal so much about you, other people or about the problems that most worry you, that this knowledge is a real salvation. For more details visit to www.joint-venture-guide.com .You&#8217;ll know if the person you love really loves you, if you&#8217;ll really be successful in your work, if your future plans will come true and if not, what you have to do to make things develop the way that you desire.

You many need to change your mind about someone or something that you desire, after learning the truth you have ignored that seemed to be so good, but in fact is not.

However, the dream warning will save your life and prevent you from getting involved with the wrong person or spend your money, time and energy in the wrong business.

This way your mental health will be preserved, because a person becomes crazy exactly when they cannot posses whom or what they most desire: this is the perfect opportunity for the wild side of their conscience to imprison them in the labyrinth of craziness.

Craziness is threatening you all the time, only because you inherited a wild, evil and violent conscience, the anti-conscience, that wants to destroy your human side and because you live in a crazy world governed by terrorism, violence, immorality and hypocrisy, where everyone is constantly dominated by their anti-conscience.

You need protection, indispensably!

If you are intelligent and you realize how tragic in fact is the reality for the human being, you must care about the information you can have translating your own dreams.

Your dreams are confused and incomprehensible to your eyes because you don&#8217;t know how to properly translate their symbolic language. As soon as you start understanding the dream language however, things become simpler and you start collecting the benefits from this occupation. I even wrote a special e-book concerning the interpretation of dreams about the person you love, using the examples of the people that have participated in my summer offer up to now (I already have too much material), with the basic dream symbols in order to show you how easy it is to interpret dreams about the person, because they are the clearer ones.
