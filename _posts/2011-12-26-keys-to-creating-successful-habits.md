We would all love to be able to walk down to the local supermarket and pick up a bottle of success. But let’s look past that fantasy and find out one of the most basic reasons why people become successful.

Right now, think of someone that you know personally who is successful. Can you see their face in your mind?

Good.

Now ask yourself this question, “Does this person have a successful routine or set of habits that makes them successful?” I would be shocked if they didn’t.

Sometimes the only difference between being successful and being average is having successful habits. Some examples of successful habits could be getting up earlier, doing thing when they need to be done, being prepared, or effective time management.

So how do you start to build these success habits in your life? Here are 4 tips on creating successful habits.

1. Identify – Find the areas in your life that need changing. Write down these new habits that need to be formed. Don’t become overwhelmed at trying to figure out how you are going to form all of these habits.

2. Pick 2 – Most people sabotage themselves by trying to change everything at once. Instead, pick one major and one minor habit that you want to form. For the next 30-90 days these will be the success habits that you will create.

3. Start small – Now that you have your two success habits, create a daily or weekly routine that is easy to follow. For instance, let’s say that you want to wake up an hour earlier so that you can get more successful things done. Instead of setting your alarm an hour earlier right at the beginning, only set it 2-5 minutes earlier every morning until you reach your goal. This way it would take you 30 days or 12 days respectively to create your success habit.

Remember, the best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time.

4. Repeat – Once you have created your new habits move on to the next 2 success habits that you want to create. Before you know it you will have created a whole new life full of success filled habits.

Just imagine where you will be in one year if you follow these four keys to creating successful habits. If it takes you only 60 days to create 2 habits, you will have created 12 success habits in just one year!
