I am a work out fanatic! I go to the gym up to 7 times a week and I sometimes go twice a day. I make a protein shake first thing in the morning, set my &nbsp;allhomesecurity&nbsp; home security alarm and I am off for my work out.

I am a member of 24 hour fitness and love it because I can go anytime. I will usually start out with an hour or so of cardio and then move on to weights. I alternate my weight days between legs, arms, chest and back. I do stomach work outs almost every day to get the elusive six pack. I am also squat crazy. I do &nbsp;squats&nbsp; whenever I get the chance. Sometimes I even do them as I walk to and from my car.

Once in a while I will join the Turbo Kick boxing class or the 24 hour cycling class. They are both great work outs and I would recommend them to any hard core athlete or gym enthusiast. Just be sure to bring your work out towel because you will work up a sweat.

My gym has a great culture which makes people excited about going. Everyone knows everyone and it is nice to see so many familiar faces all the time. Even the staff is friendly which in my experience is fairly rare.
