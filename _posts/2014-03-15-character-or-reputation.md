Character or Reputation. When we see these two words together, we often mistakenly believe that you cannot have one without the other.

Reputation in a nutshell is what others around us think of us. It is really the opinion that is held by others concerning who we are, and the motives they believe we have in doing what we do. We can have a &#8220;good&#8221; reputation, or a &#8220;bad&#8221; reputation. However, we must realize that either of those are relative, and a &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221; reputation is only in the eye of the beholder.

Much more valuable is our Character. Character in a nutshell, is who we are when no one is looking. It is not just the face in the mirror, but the &#8220;face behind the face&#8221;. A person with Godly character is one who can stand fast in the face of false accusations, insinuations, slander, and ridicule. They remain rock solid in the midst of these things, even though the hurt may be real, the despair and depression cannot take hold of them, and bring them to defeat.

When Joseph was falsely accused by Potiphar&#8217;s wife in the Old Testament, and was thrown from a high place of honor in the palace, into prison, one might say that his &#8220;repuation&#8221; was destroyed. &#8220;He said, she said&#8230;&#8221; He spent 12 long years in prison, the &#8220;victim&#8221; of unfounded allegations. However, his character remained strong! Even in prison, he did not languish in bitterness, and look for ways to seek revenge on those who had hurt him. He knew his day would come. Character knows no time restraints.

As you know, his day did come, and he became second in command in Egypt, and was in charge of food distribution during a great famine that he had prophesied would take place.

Reputations come and go. Character will hold you through the storms. Develop character, and you will never have regrets
