This guest post from Alden Strong

When I was younger, I had an older cousin who was my designated babysitter. When I was nine, she announced her engagement to a man who was, in the eyes of a child, more awesome than cake, but in the eyes of her parents, a delinquent. Regardless of the varying degrees of acceptance, the wedding planning commenced and being quite lucky, I was allowed the chance to become the flower girl.

On the day of the wedding ceremony, my mother made sure to arm our &nbsp;HOME SECURITY&nbsp; alarm system since we lived in a somewhat sketchy neighborhood. Weddings are happy occasions and my mother wanted to keep it that way by taking care of all the necessary precautions. When we arrived at the church, I was getting a bit of stage fright but I took a deep breath and marched on. The boy who accompanied me was his younger cousin, a boy two years older then me, and at the time devastatingly cute. Not only did I have to lay down the petals, I also had to keep my face from turning bright red. As I marched down the aisle it was exciting to toss petals everywhere and before I knew it, I was waiting with the &nbsp;bridesmaids&nbsp; for the bride to appear.
