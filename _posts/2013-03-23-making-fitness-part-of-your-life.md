The pressures of daily life can be daunting, and with demanding careers and raising a family, working out is probably the last thing on your mind at the end of a busy day. However, physical fitness can benefit you in more ways than you think.

Being physically fit is not only about conquering marathons in record time and not only about looking your best on the beach &#8212; even though looking your best is always a bonus. Being physically fit can help you live a longer, more fulfilling life, it can benefit your body, your self-esteem and help you deal with the stresses of daily life.

Isn’t it ironic how you always manage to find the time to watch TV, time to catch up on your favorite program or the time to get together with friends? Yet when it comes to going to gym or getting physical, you can easily come up with at least 10 different reasons why you’re either too busy or just don’t have the time to break a sweat.

Making fitness part of your life should be a priority in everyone’s life &#8212; it should become a daily habit, the same as brushing your teeth or taking a shower. Setting aside one hour of your day isn’t much to ask when you take into account all the positive things you achieve just by being physically fit.

Apart from looking and feeling good, working out can benefit you in the following areas as well:

* Help to relieve stress, depression and anxiety

* Increase your ability to concentrate, think faster and become more sharp

* Help reduce blood pressure

* Lower the risk of developing colon cancer

* Keep your heart healthy and reduce the risk of heart disease

* Help with gaining muscle, which can build and maintain strong bones

* Increase flexibility, which can help prevent injury and help with muscular tension.

So next time you put off going to the gym, stop and think about all the benefits you’re missing out on. Just 30 minutes to an hour of physical fitness a day can be a major health investment. And remember you don’t have to be in a gym to be fit. You can enjoy fitness with your kids, your spouse, family or friends by coming up with fun, physical activities such as going for walks, swimming, mountain biking, hiking or playing golf to mention a few.

GET A PLAN

There are many great fitness plans out there that can help you get into shape and enjoy fitness, but there are also many scams that promise you the world and don’t deliver. If you have spare cash on hand, get in touch with a personal trainer at your gym and take up a few sessions that will help you with your goals. You can also browse the Internet for reputable sites for information.

KICK START YOUR FITNESS PLAN

If you’re a beginner into the world of fitness, ease into a routine by starting off slowly and gradually increase your endurance level. If you go all out on the first day, chances are you’ll burn out and overwork yourself to the extent that you’ll be put off fitness forever. If you’re a newbie, also remember that it takes time to get into a fitness routine and the only way to reach your ideal level is be consistent and stick with the program.

MAKE TIME

The best way to ensure that you avoid the excuses-zone is to make a habit of getting your workouts done first thing in the morning. Set your alarm to wake up an hour earlier, get to the gym and from there, you can shower and head for work. By doing your workout in the morning you are more likely to put it off later due to tiredness (or laziness), plus research has shown that you burn more fat if you do your cardio sessions first thing in the morning on an empty stomach.
