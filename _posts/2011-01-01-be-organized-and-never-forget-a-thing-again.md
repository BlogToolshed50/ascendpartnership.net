Being forgetful about little things isn&#8217;t a good sign of leading a healthy mind or good memory. These things are important in terms of allowing your mind to create its own association with the things in the past that you have been used to and the just the thought of you being on this state creates an even bigger conflict with upcoming tasks.

But let us not forget the people with commendable memory. They may have nothing in particular to worry about especially when it comes to memorization tasks, but these people still and will experience a slip of thought time and again. It may be just little things, like saying you have misplaced your keys because you have forgotten where you last put it in the first place. For you it may just be a simple “misplacement” of important objects, but if you try to think about it at a different level, it is actually a memory problem. The bad news is that, it could even become worse than how it is today.

Again, these things may be simple. Other than forgetting where you have placed your car keys this morning, things like important events and deadlines can slip off of your mind as well and this could become a bad habit. Good news is, you can take control of these things. You can stop yourself from developing absentmindedness because when it takes over you, your natural instinct of organizing things properly also slips away.

When you try to think about it, there is actually a great significance as to how a person organize his thoughts and in turn, the things that matters around him. Improving your memory can be done in so many ways but destroying it can also happen in a snap and there are still more factors that contribute to memory failure.

This time, it&#8217;s simple. Try your best to be organized. If remembering where you placed your car keys is a problem, use a container you can easily spot and place it where it can easily be seen. If remembering names is too much, ask more information about the person, his whereabouts, achievements and acquaintances. The things that he say are going to imprint memory anchors to your brain which holds on to his name. There are many ideas how you can simply prevent forgetfulness but it is up to you apply it.
