Thanks to Erasmo Cortez

Every year the college football season comes down to a fantastic weekend, which is the &nbsp;College Football&nbsp; Conference Championship weekend, which normally has three games between conference rivals that are competing for the overall conference title. My favorite conference championship to watch each year is the SEC Championship game.

This year, the SEX Championship game will take place between the Auburn Tigers and the South Carolina Gamecocks. This game not only has implications for the conference championship, but it will help decide the National Championship game as well. If the Tigers manage to beat South Carolina, they will advance to the National Championship game, where they will most likely face the Oregon Ducks.

The Auburn Tigers will also be followed by many because they have quarterback Cameron Newton. Newton is widely considered one of the best players in the country and has an excellent chance of winning the Heisman Trophy, which is the most highly respected trophy in sports.

While going to the game would be fun, it can be just as exciting to watch it with friends at home or at a bar. I enjoy watching the game on my satellite television from &nbsp;direc4u.com&nbsp;.
