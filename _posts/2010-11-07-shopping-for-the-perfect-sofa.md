After browsing through countless chain stores searching fruitlessly for the perfect sofa, I give up and decide to try some alternative shops. Although going furniture shopping has never been my favorite pastime, I throw on my jacket, grab my bag and head out the door to go downtown for a more interesting selection.

The oldest part of the downtown area is being renovated &#8211; a &#8220;renaissance&#8221; type of building plan is going on, which attracts a lot of artsy shops, outdoor cafes, and galleries. One of my favorite haunts is &#8220;Louis Antiques and Furniture&#8221;, a favorite of interior designers looking for that perfect accent piece like a Moroccan vase or zebra rug.

Louis has a quirky, &nbsp;eclectic furniture store&nbsp;. The old building isn&#8217;t well-lit, so accent lamps are turned on for a bit of ambiance for the shoppers. I am able to eliminate most of the expensive antique sofas which are just too formal for my family room, but just at the very back of the third floor, is a loveseat with a fabulous rich green and blue abstract pattern. Wood accents, painted gold, really set off this contemporary and fun sofa.

Luckily, I have my SUV with me, and the loveseat fits right in. When I get home, I plan to watch &nbsp;satellite tv&nbsp; with my husband on that perfect new sofa. Mission accomplished!
