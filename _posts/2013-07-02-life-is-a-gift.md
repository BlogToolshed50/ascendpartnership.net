Life Is A Gift &#8211; Author unknown &#8211; This is another one of those emails that people forward on to friends and ask them to pass on to others. . . which I &#8220;rarely&#8221; do. However, when I read something as powerful as this, I keep it and pass it on to you, my readers.
  
Why not take a moment and print it out and post it in an area where you won&#8217;t miss reading it . . . often. Hopefully it will be a source of inspiration, motivation and encouragement.

Today before you think of saying an unkind word &#8211; Think of someone who can&#8217;t speak.

Today, before you complain about the taste of your food &#8211; Think of someone who has nothing to eat.

Today, before you complain about your husband or wife &#8211; Think of someone who&#8217;s crying out to God for a companion.

Today before you complain about life &#8211; Think of someone who left this earth too early; we hope they went to Heaven.

Today,before you complain about your children &#8211; Think of someone who desires children but they&#8217;re barren.

Today, before you argue about your dirty house that someone (like your child or spouse) didn&#8217;t clean or sweep &#8211; Think of the people who are living in the streets.

Today, before dreading and grumbling about the distance you must drive to work &#8211; Think of someone who has no transportation and must walk everywhere they need to go.

Today, when you are tired and complain about your job &#8211; Think of the unemployed, the disabled and those who wished they had your job.

Today, before you think of pointing the finger or condemning another &#8211; Remember that not one of us are without wrong doings.

Today, when depressing thoughts seem to get you down &#8211; force a smile on your face and be THANKFUL.

TODAY: Life is a gift. Live it. Enjoy it. Celebrate it. And be THANKFUL.
