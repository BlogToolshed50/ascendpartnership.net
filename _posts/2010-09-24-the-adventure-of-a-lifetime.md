Guest post of the week by Brittany Booker

When I go hiking I personally love to go either to &nbsp;Yellowstone National Park&nbsp;, and South Dakota parks. When I go hiking I also take into account who I will bring, in my case it is usually close friends and relatives around my age who share the same desire for adventure and discovery as me. Before leaving for our expeditions we usually take into account a few details that could haunt us while we are away from home like leaving the garage door open, setting my &nbsp;ADT medical&nbsp; and home security alarm, and feeding my pet fish(Pablo).

Upon arrival to my hiking destination I fill up my waterbottle, make sure I have a map, and am wearing appropriate clothing. In my experience when you go hiking and wear shorts through thick underbrush your legs tend to get pretty brused so take into account the geography that your hiking through. In Yellowstone there are a lot of different hiking trails that I went on with tons of scenic views overlooking lakes and incredible wildlife so keep Yellowstone in mind. Also when I was in South Dakota I went hiking on the hills around Mount Rushmore which was absolutely breath-taking. So when you look for good places to take scenic and memory making hikes remember these two places.
