Personal mastery can even help you let go of bad habits and behaviour. For example, personal mastery can help you get over with smoking or alcoholic addiction. You do not only address the habit but deals with the reason why you have started the habit in the first place. The difference is when you only address the habit, it is possible for it to come back again. But when you tackle the issues behind the habit, it would make you stop the habit altogether.

One of the great things about personal mastery is that it can be applied whether you want to improve your career, leadership or your organization. Personal mastery can even help you with career, whether you would like to change your path or would like to improve your performance in the current career you are in.
