Not long back, I was in search of a cool low cost car. I expected the car to have run within a 100 miles, offered at the lowest price.  My primary preference for the models was a &nbsp;nissan 370z&nbsp; . A number of websites online claim to host car reviews and sale listings but I was disappointed with most of them. The primary reason for my dislike of such sites outdated information.  Most review sites also host reviews written neither by experts nor real users.

My colleague recently purchased a &nbsp;ford taurus&nbsp; at an unbelievable price. I wanted to explore further and found out about a review and listings website by the name thecarconnection.com . My close examination of the site revealed such exciting information about both new and used cars. Their search section helped me search based on my zip code too .

The nice part of the site is that the reviews are consumer generated and hence you are most likely to get the first hand information of how it feels to own a particular car. Unlike the huge number of hours that I have spend in the past looking in vain for a a nice used car, I have converged to two choices. A 2001 &nbsp;gmc acadia&nbsp; that has run around 130K miles that perfectly fits my color choice and a 2006 &nbsp;honda cr-v&nbsp; .

I am so excited for the day I get home one of those. What ever the car that I finally decide to buy, it would  not be  possible without the wonderful reviews and search facility of thecarconnection.com . Make sure to refine your search based on miles, year, price, location, vehicle or fuel type when you look for a car.
