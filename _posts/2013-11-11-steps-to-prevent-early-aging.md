Many benefits are available to those who reach the golden years of their life: wisdom, a relaxed style of life, a lifetime of memories and in some states, free bus passes. Of course, these advantages are balanced by the fact that as part of the aging process, parts of the body may stop functioning as they once used to. A sobering thought, but you can take solace in the knowledge that people are leading a fuller life than ever before. This has been achieved, in part, through the advances in our knowledge of nutrition and the aging process.

Nutrition is a Bigger Concern in the Elderly

Good nutrition is general knowledge today but it may be increasingly difficult for people to absorb all the nutrients they require as they get older. Supplementing certain vitamins in the form of an anti aging supplement becomes a necessity. Loss of appetite can also exacerbate this deficiency, and may be caused by lowered physical activity and the side effects of medication. The figures show a grim reality &#8211; nearly 50% of Americans aged 65 and over are on more than three prescription drugs. Also, over time, the gastro-intestinal tract, kidneys and liver are less efficient and can not process the nutrients that the body normally gains through eating.

You should also check to find out if any of the ingredients interact with your prescription drugs so tell your doctor and pharmacist what you are taking. Unfortunately, there is not a high level of understanding in the medical or pharmaceutical world into herbs and nutraceuticals although some research has been conducted into vitamins and the popular herbs.
