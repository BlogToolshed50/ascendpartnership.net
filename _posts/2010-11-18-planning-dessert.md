It&#8217;s been proven in studies that people most often remember the first and last things, so that convinces me even more that it&#8217;s really important to finish off meals right with a great dessert. Besides, if someone has a really great meal overall, they&#8217;ll probably remember the dessert most of all in the end.

I&#8217;ve been given the assignment to come up with all of the desserts for my family&#8217;s Thanksgiving dinner, so I did some major searching for some recipes online with my &nbsp;Clearwire Boston&nbsp;.

I&#8217;ve decided to make a red velvet cake, a pumpkin pie and a &nbsp;sour cream lemon pie&nbsp; because I&#8217;d liek to give everyone options, and I&#8217;ll get to take home more dessert left overs in the end. IÕve never made sour cream lemon pie before, but IÕve had it a couple of times and really liked it. I think that any of my three desserts will leave people happy and full with their sweet teeth satisfied and remembering how great my desserts were.
