Biotechnology is a relatively new industry and much of the techniques are still in their infancy, in other words, complete reliability for these protocols has not yet been established. Given this fact, it cannot be assured that the all the doctors would be receptive to be sophisticated modern molecular techniques for disease diagnosis and treatment. There are still a lot of old conservative doctors out there who might consider these modern techniques to be foreign and unsafe and so, they might not be willing to risk their diagnosis by handling the samples to modern labs for screening. For example, two of my aunts are doctors since mid-1970s and the other day, I was asking them if they would patronize molecular screening and diagnostic methods. They were not able to give me a firm yes.

They were still skeptical about the modern molecular biology techniques and they wouldn&#8217;t risk their patient samples to such labs. Well it does make sense. Let&#8217;s say the doctor had graduated from a med school in 1965. During those times, they wouldn&#8217;t have studied a lot of biochemistry or molecular biology and the like. Many doctors do try their best to keep up with the latest advancements in medical technology, but there a few who don&#8217;t do this and I am talking about them. Explain about BCR-ABL to an old doctor and most probably you will get a blank expression back from him. Again- I am not saying &#8216;all&#8217; &#8211; just a &#8216;few&#8217;. Diagnostics company need to keep this in mind when reaching their target market.
