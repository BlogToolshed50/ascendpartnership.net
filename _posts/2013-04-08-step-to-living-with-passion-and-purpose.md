What is Your Purpose?

Are you living Your Passion?

Living your passion has a flow. You may have heard the phrase “in the flow.” It comes quite naturally and cannot be forced. Nothing happens while you wait on the river bank. A ship may come along, but it will only carry you where IT is going. Where do YOU want to go? Here are four action steps to assist you along the way.

1) Declare and Define: When you reflect back on your life, what is the one thing that, having done it, would give you peace? This question works so much better than…gee….what am I good at, what do I enjoy doing? We can come up with many different answers to those types of questions, but something about this question gets to the heart of the matter. A small still voice will speak to you. Treasure and protect it, but don’t hide it. This is your passion. Declare it. It is not important where it will lead. More will be revealed once you declare it. The clarity does not come until you honor your truth. Now define it with these questions. How can I be of service? Who is searching for what I have to share? The answers will help you define what it is you are called to do. Your purpose.

2) Decorate and Develop: It is important to start with YOUR passion. You can busy yourself with distractions. You can try other safer things, but your unique calling lingers in the background waiting. Waiting for you to be brave. Create a space for your passion and decorate it. Hang up your vision board. Cover the walls with affirmations. Buy candles. Paint. Whatever! This is your space. Make it known what you are doing. Don’t keep it a secret. Set boundaries around the time you require in your space. Make lists. Purchase tools. Find teachers. Seek the wisdom of those who have gone before you. Open your eyes, your ears, and your heart to the miracles that show up. Develop.

3) Dive in and Discover: Remember the first time you stood on the edge of a diving board. You started thinking …..What if? This is when many will quit. Diving generates some resistance, but resistance can be your greatest teacher. Opportunities will show up, and they seem too scary. Financial challenges surface. We allow ourselves to become overwhelmed. We can take a breath. Then we can allow our ego to feel the fear and dive in anyway. Accept and Observe. What obsolete beliefs no longer serve you? Who do you desire to forgive? When we discover what lies underneath our fears, true transformation is possible. It is through this courage to move forward that we find peace and are healed. This step, though it may seem foreboding and may tempt you to quit, is actually quite beautiful and God affirming. There is a reason for everything. Trust the process of discovery.

4) Dance and Deliver: Celebrate your progress! It is easy to forget how far we have come. When we are finally living our passion, we experience a sense of urgency. If we then turn this into fear and lack, we may get stuck in the past or future. Take this urgency and dance. Dance in the moment. It is not important to “get there” in order to start sharing. Share how you arrived at Step One. Deliver your message of hope and belief. Deliver your message to the world that all is possible with faith.
