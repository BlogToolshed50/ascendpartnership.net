This past holiday week was especially fantastic! The wife and I raised a great son, and his generosity simply blew us away. He invited us to come down to &nbsp;Georgia&nbsp; to spend time his new little family. He has a beautiful wife and she recently gave birth to our two adorable grandsons. This Christmas was the first time we got see them! Our son started off our trip by setting us up in a very nice hotel close to his home. He even covered the costs for the nights we were there! He was a wonderful host and he was able to take care of us and his family while remaining in an excellent mood. He also helped schedule me a quick appointment to see a hearing specialist to gets a new pair of &nbsp;Miracle Ear&nbsp; hearing aids so that I could really enjoy the quality time together.

Success has really changed our boy for the better. He really seems like he√ïs on top of the world, and his been incredibly generous and doting. He must have gotten those traits from his mother. He showed us a wonderful time, and we miss being in Georgia already.
