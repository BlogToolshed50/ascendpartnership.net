While I&#8217;ll gladly turn on my satellite TV from &nbsp;BestChoiceTV&nbsp; in a pinch in order to watch baseball, there&#8217;s something about going out to the ballpark that I&#8217;ve always enjoyed. For me, &nbsp;baseball stadiums&nbsp; offer an atmosphere that is missing in any of the other professional sports. The casual nature of the ballpark, the ability to chat freely with friends and fans between pitches, the overpriced, but still delicious concession food; they all remind us that baseball was there first, that it perfected sports fandom in America while sports like football or basketball were in their infancy. Baseball beat them all to the punch, so it&#8217;s unsurprising that it should accomplish the task of atmosphere best.

I think I enjoy the intimacy of baseball most of all. Even if I&#8217;m in the nosebleed seats, it&#8217;s possible to remain connected and uniquely invested in the game. I think it&#8217;s because baseball is, at the same time, a sport that requires consummate concentration, to fully grasp what&#8217;s going on, while still allowing ample time for conversation between friends. Above being an athletic experience, going out to a baseball game is an intensely social experience, one that you don&#8217;t really get with any of the other sports.

Iâ€™ve managed to go to at least one baseball game a year for the past three years, but Iâ€™m missing going out to a baseball game this year. While this makes me sad, Iâ€™m ultimately untroubled. Baseball has stood through war, through Depression and recession, through terror, and through tragedy. Itâ€™ll surely be there for me when I get to go out to the ballpark again next year.
