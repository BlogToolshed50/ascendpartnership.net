The article written by Frances Blevins

Some people hate grocery shopping, but I secretly love it. I recently relocated to the Normandy area of France with my husband. I was worried at first because the French are, let us face it, a little scary and intimidating. Luckily, it has turned out to be an incredible experience for me. Plus, I get to shop in all these great little markets and artisan shops. You can find everything at an absolute gourmet level but at rock-bottom prices.

There is nothing I love more then a loaf of a fresh baguette spread with unsalted butter in the morning with my little espresso. Yum! I head to the local bakery after I set my &nbsp;home Security&nbsp; alarm and head out the door. I love living in a small community where everyone knows who your name. I do not speak much French but, with some effort the locals are warming up to me. I really enjoy visiting my butcher. It does not hurt to flirt with him a little because then he will give me the best cuts of meat. Then I go to the regular grocery store to pick up eggs, milk, produce and other little crackers for the &nbsp;dinner party&nbsp; we are having tonight. I hate cooking but, when I do it for friends and family, I do not mind it quite so much.
