Today, kids have more worries and face more pressures than ever before. Here a few tips to help your child focus on and do well in school.

1. Create a personal schedule

Recording everything that must be done on a calendar or &#8220;to do&#8221; list will help him to keep track of important dates and deadlines. If he keeps it in a visible place he will have no problem acknowledging upcoming events and will be better able to plan how and where to spend his time.

A &#8220;to do&#8221; list would also help him to prioritize his tasks. When it comes to homework, whatever is most important should be tackled first.

2. Watch the clock

Setting an alarm for the morning is a must. I also recommend setting his clock or watch five minutes ahead since it&#8217;s always easy to run late. When it comes to something like catching a bus, just five minutes can make a significant difference.

3. Focus

He should train himself to be able to concentrate solely on one specific task. This is much easier in a noise-free environment. No T.V or radio should be on to distract him.

4. Get enough sleep

Lack of sleep is proven to take a toll on us physically. The more sleep we get, the more alert we are. We thus have more energy to handle life&#8217;s daily tasks. The average adult needs at least six hours of sleep a night and the average child needs at least eight.

5. Stay in shape

Through spending time outdoors or playing sports with friends, he can &#8220;blow off some steam&#8221; so to speak, as well as re-energize. Encourage him to get outside.

6. Talk through your problems

Being able to share his concerns with you will alleviate the frustration of keeping things bottled up. Sharing feelings often makes them easier to deal with. If you make it clear that you understand him and are willing to help, not only will you contribute to his emotional health but you&#8217;ll help build an open and honest relationship as well.
