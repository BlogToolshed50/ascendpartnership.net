Success is never by accident or luck. Real success depends on how much of your potential you develop and use. If you want to achieve permanent, sustainable success, you must acquire vast reserves of inner strength, determination, and desire. You must have the ability to motivate yourself. Harnessing the power of personal motivation is the key to creating your pathway to success.

#1 &#8211; There&#8217;s No Time Like the Present
  
Personal motivation is exactly what these two words indicate: the ability to motivate yourself to accomplishment. It must be personal, deep-rooted and a part of your innermost thoughts. Opportunities are everywhere for those who use personal motivation. So, what are you waiting for?

#2 &#8211; The Power of a Plan
  
The power of personal motivation comes from a definite, personalized plan of action and the application of that plan every day in your life. Personal motivation begins with an honest self-appraisal. First, ask yourself &#8220;Where do I stand now?&#8221; Be honest with yourself about your strengths, weaknesses, assets, and liabilities.

Next, ask yourself what your goals are. Be clear about what you really want in each of the six most important areas of your life: family, financial, mental, physical, spiritual, and social. With your starting and ending points well-defined, write out your plan in black and white. This plan becomes your personal map to success.

#3 &#8211; Enthusiastically Desire Change
  
Create within yourself a sincere desire for the things you want in life. After deciding what you want to change in your life, a burning desire is unquestionably the greatest motivator of every human action. True desire will strengthen your resolve to attain your specific goals in all six areas of your life.

Desire allows you to persevere through a problem while others give up, and it carries within it your deepest convictions. A powerful partner of desire is enthusiasm; it provides the fuel and the &#8220;can do&#8221; attitude to set &#8220;impossible&#8221; goals and overcome tremendous obstacles. Besides, enthusiasm is contagious and inspires others to help and support you in your goals.

#4 &#8211; Believe with Confidence
  
The primary element necessary for any beginning enterprise &#8211; the one factor that will guarantee your success &#8211; is the confidence that it can be done. The major difference between high achievers and those who fail is self-confidence. Self-confidence actively sells you and your ideas; it builds your success power.
  
Confidence reinforces ability, doubles energy, expands mental faculties, and increases your personal power. It is a psychological fact that people act like the person they believe themselves to be. Every time you say to yourself, &#8220;I can do it and I will do it,&#8221; you are strengthening your determination and forming good thinking habits &#8211; habits that manifest in positive action.

Keep this in mind: The only way you can change your world is to change your mind. The power of personal motivation comes through a definite, personalized Plan of Action and the application of that plan every day of your life. Your desire, confidence, and determination will stimulate a ceaseless flow of dynamic, powerful, positive direction to keep you on course until your goals are realized.

Highly successful people have all found a way to cultivate a decisive, well-developed plan that uses all their strengths and abilities to their maximum potential. By focusing on one day at a time, you can begin the exciting journey of creating your pathway to success and fulfilling your own personal goals and dreams.
