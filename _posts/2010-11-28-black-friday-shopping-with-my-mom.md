One of my most favorite days of the year is Black Friday. It was not always the case for me. I used to avoid going Black Friday shopping as I thought only crazy people would wake up at dawn or in the middle of the night just to get some good deals. I thought that until my mom talked me into going with her one year.

My mom was always a Black Friday shopper. I can remember her years ago getting up and heading out for hours and coming home with lots of bags filled with presents and her excited over the amount of money she had saved. Finally after many years of pleading with me to go, I gave in and went with her. I was surprised at how much fun it really is!

As home burglaries are on the rise during the Christmas season I, of course, set my home security alarm from &nbsp;Besthomesecurity.com&nbsp; before heading out into the early morning with her. We listened to Christmas carols on the radio and talked about all the gifts we wanted to buy, who we needed to buy for and the stores we wanted to go to.

While it was very &nbsp;crowded,&nbsp; it was also exciting and I have to admit, I saved a bundle. Now it is a tradition for us. We go every year and each year we are just as pleased as the first.
