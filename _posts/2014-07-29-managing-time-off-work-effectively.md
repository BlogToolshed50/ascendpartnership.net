I recently had two weeks off of work due to a minor operation which left me with limited mobility, looking back at my time off I think I didnâ€™t make the most of this time off. So with the help of some work colleagues, we have compiled a list of some productive and not so productive tasks and activities.

Family tree
  
How well do you know your family? Is there any royalty in the family? With online services popping up all over the internet, you can now trace back your family tree. These are not only interesting to look at but can be made into gifts that you can give to family members.

Learn a new skill
  
Depending on what job you are currently doing, there will probably be plenty of new skills you could learn in that area. These could range from starting a course through the Open University online or learning a skill such as Photo-shop or html website design. You never know, when you return to work your new skill may lead to a promotion.

Catch up with old friends
  
With internet phenomenons such as Facebook and MySpace, catching up with old friends over the net is easier than ever. These tools often allow you to find people you have long forgotten through searching schools you may have attended together. Why not send a message to your old school mates and see what they are up to these days. You never know, you may end up meeting up with an old flame.

Invent something
  
TV programs such Dragons Den have glamorized the world of inventions. I&#8217;m sure everyone has thought of at least one clever idea for a gadget over the years. Well why not use your spare time, to develop one of these ideas and see if you can make your idea reality. Some useful information for budding inventors.

Learn an instrument
  
Video games such as rock band and guitar hero have sparked interest in learning an instrument. Some people may argue that the games dumb down the skill it takes to actually play an instrument, but I believe that they have inspired children and adults alike to try to play a real instrument. Some professionals have stated that if you can play a drum part on expert difficulty on rock band you could play the same part on a real drum kit. Many sites offer free lessons and guides which will help you make progress with your new instrument.

Many people end up with time on their hands when they have an accident at work, hopefully this list will help people kill some spare time
