Is your life so busy you just don&#8217;t seem to get anything done? This is an article with tips on how to find time to do the things on your list that you want to do.

At 4&#8217;9 my grandmother was a strong, hard working, loving woman. I remember how her apron pockets always seemed to hold a delicate white handkerchief and little treasures, such as pink semi soft mints.

We always felt so special when Grandma gave us one of those mints or offered her handkerchief to wipe our little noses. My mother also used her pockets to hold a handkerchief and today, in my pockets, there are always tissues handy. Our pockets have been well used.

Similar to the pockets on our clothing, we all have pocketsâ€¦ pockets of time. We may have a 10 to 15 minutes &#8216;pocket&#8217; of time during the day as we sit waiting for something to get done or procrastinating the start of a large project. Those small pockets of time have the potential to be productive and very rewarding!

&#8220;What can I use those pockets for?&#8221; you may be asking. Here are a few ideas: take off that old nail polish, better yet call for a manicure appointment, read a magazine article you have been meaning to get to, straighten up the bathroom counter, dust the pictures in a room, call an old friend and have a short chat, crop some photos for scrap booking, or slip them into a sleeve of an album, make a grocery list for that &#8220;inevitable grocery run&#8221;, clean out your purse/wallet, throw away those old receipts. The list can go on and on.

You get the idea! Simply, by using these little pockets of time you won&#8217;t be so overwhelmed with all you have to do. Soon people will be saying to you, &#8220;You get more done than anyone I know!&#8221; And you can think, &#8220;It&#8217;s because I use my pockets, pockets of time that is.&#8221;
