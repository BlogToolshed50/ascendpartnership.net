This guest post from Margaret Mills

Most people who take a girl on a date will take them to the movies. How predictable is that? What makes it even worse is that they take her to a romantic comedy? Err &#8230; quite far from spontaneous, pal. You gotta do it the right way, which is your way. In other words, do you want. Take control. Girls love that. Just make sure you&#8217;re confident in your decision. For example, instead of taking my girlfriend to the movies and seeing a romantic comedy, we watched a scary movie on &nbsp;Directv&nbsp;. It was called &nbsp;The Fourth Kind&nbsp;. This might not be a traditional date night movie, but that&#8217;s what made it so great. We were snuggling, so every time she got scared, she would grab my arm really tight. I knew this meant she relied on me for protection, which was pretty cool. Not to mention, the movie was pretty good.

I&#8217;m sorry that I&#8217;m going to ruin it for you, but The Fourth Kind is a hoax. It was actually very good. They should have just said that it was fiction from the beginning. They tried to pull off the old Blair Witch Project stunt, but to no avail. I think that trick is getting a little old (see Paranormal Activity). That said, The Fourth Kind is still my favorite date night movie. It was the first movie me and my girlfriend watched together and we&#8217;ll always remember that.
