Guest post written by Carl Barnes

Lots of people compliment us on our &nbsp;garden&nbsp;, which I love hearing because I do put a lot of hard work and thought into making it look good.

When my daughter&#8217;s long time boyfriend finally proposed to her and she said yes, they told us that they wanted to have the reception at our house. I started worrying and stressing out immediately after that, even more than I imagine a mother of the bride normally does. So we wanted to make sure that everything about our home looks perfect because so many people are going to be there for the special day.

We contacted &nbsp;SEARS Home improvement&nbsp; and got them to come out and put on some new siding on our house. Our old siding was starting to look pretty worn down and we&#8217;re not exactly going for the rustic look here, as much as how cute I think shabby chic is. Now I&#8217;m relieved that how our house looks is one less thing that I have to worry about for the big wedding day.
