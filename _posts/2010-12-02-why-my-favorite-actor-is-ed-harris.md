I have to admit that I am not much of a movie viewer. I just never seem to have the time to sit down and watch movie after movie the way that some people seem to do. The idea also never particularly appealed to me. That is why even I was surprised that I was able to name my favorite actor very quickly off of the top of my head. This person had to be so talented at what they do to grab my attention.

I first saw Ed Harris on my &nbsp;Cable TV&nbsp; when watching the classic movie &nbsp;Apollo 13&nbsp;&#8221;. The movie itself is great, but the role that was played by Mr. Harris was really quite powerful in my opinion. He was the person who was in charge of the whole mission and he played his role to perfection. That is not something that is easy to do when you are portraying real life events. That is why I decided to follow up on other movies done in Ed Harris&#8217; career. I soon watched &#8220;The Truman Show&#8221; after that and was equally pleased about his abilities in that movie. Although that one was not based on any real life event, he was able to make you feel as though it was. Of the few movies that I do watch, I will make sure that Ed Harris&#8217; movies are some of them.
