• Be safe by removing hazards. One of the best ways to create a safe environment for anyone who is aging is to look at their current environment and remove hazards. Throw rugs are a big tripping hazard as are cords running across rooms. Either tape them down or remove them all together. Small tables and stools or table and chair legs that stick out into walking areas are also tripping hazards. Remove all items from traffic lanes and exits, such as piles of books, boxes or shoes.

• Be safe by adding some features. Add lighting where needed -insufficient lighting can cause accidents or difficulty in completing tasks. Make sure there is a phone by the bed and emergency numbers are easily accessible. Provide textures strips or no-slip mats and grab rails in the bath tub and shower. Make sure there is a safe and stable step stool available. Check the condition and location of smoke detectors. Ensure that medication have a safe storage location and are kept in clearly labeled containers.

• Start small. If you know you have poor vision and may need assistive aids as you age, then get them as you replace current household items. Next time you buy a telephone, shop for a big button phone, or a jumbo remote control, a high visibility keyboard, jumbo display thermometer or alarm clock. There are products available that will help you in all areas of your life.

• Be proactive &#8211; make some changes before you actually need them. When you are buying a new home or adding on to your existing home, when you purchase new home or office furniture or as you shop for kitchenware – these are all opportunities to start creating an environment that is tailored to the needs you may face as you age.

• Introduce assistive devices. If you have difficulty hearing, purchase a ring amplifier for your telephone and a vibrating alarm clock. If you have trouble dressing, try a sock aid, button hook, dressing stick, long handled shoe horn or elastic shoe laces. Difficulty grasping objects – try an electric can opener, easy grip utensils, door knob levers, a key turner, built up light switch and a playing card holder. Can’t get out of your favorite easy chair – try a uplift seat assist.

There are thousands of products that promote independence and assist you in all areas of life. If you are having difficulty in an area there is most likely an assistive device that can help you.

By following the above suggestions you will be creating an environment for healthy aging and also a safe, happy comfortable and functional environment where you can live independently and age gracefully.
