Cholesterol is one of the components in the human body. It gives the needed energy to perform various functions. It should be maintained at an optimum level to avoid any ill effect. If it crosses the thresh hold limit it leads to heart attack. In countries like Germany half of the death in a year is due to heart attack. This is due to negligence on the part of the people to undergo periodical check up with regard to the cholesterol level. Items containing fat increases the level of cholesterol in the body. It is a must that one should eat items having fat in a limited manner to avoid health problems.
