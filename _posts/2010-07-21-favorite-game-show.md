Thanks for the article from Graham Burton

One of my favorite game shows to watch is called &nbsp;Silent Library&nbsp;. It&#8217;s fairly newer, but it&#8217;s one of the first newer game shows that I really enjoy! What makes the show so great is the humor incorporated into it. I don&#8217;t think I could stand to watch it if it weren&#8217;t so funny. I usually record the show when I&#8217;m unable to watch it because I have a DVR I got from &nbsp;bestchoicetv&nbsp;. It really helps out when I&#8217;ve got to work or when I&#8217;m busy.

The purpose of the show is to allow contestants complete a number of challenges in a library. The trick to the show is that they have to keep quiet while doing the challenges, and this is usually pretty hard because most of the challenges are hilarious. The host is the librarian and he observes the contestants as they complete the challenges so that he can decide whether they are being too loud or not. The contestants are usually paid large sums of money for completing challenges. The harder the challenge is, the more money the group of contestants wins for keeping quiet.

They usually have gender-based shows meaning that some shows will have all female contestants, and some will have all male contestants. I really like the all girl contestants because they are the funniest to watch. I really hope MTV doesn&#8217;t stop airing the show, because they seem to discontinue every show that is good.
