I appreciate the guest post, Ignacio Phillips

There are so many shows about fashion I am so glad there is one that is finally just getting to the point. This show is rightfully called The Fashion Show. In this show 15 designers compete against each other in various competitions showcasing their pieces and talents. The reason I started watching this show is because one night I was channel surfing on my satellite TV from &nbsp;Direct TV Colorado&nbsp; and saw Kelly Rowland, member of &nbsp;Destiny&#8217;s Child&nbsp; was the host and couldn&#8217;t help but stop and see what it was about. She has such a classy, elegant style I think they chose the perfect host in her. Come to find out, I love this show. These designers are so talented I personally think each and every one of them deserves a bit of recognition. The challenges they face, supplies and time they are given, it is insane to me the gorgeous pieces most of them come up with! I love how blunt and real the judges are with the contestants, it is nice to see some honest and professional opinions. I also cant help but enjoy the drama that occurs between the contestants, I mean in the fashion world there is no shortage of drama, so you can only image what happens when you put fifteen fabulous designers in one house and work to compete against each other.
