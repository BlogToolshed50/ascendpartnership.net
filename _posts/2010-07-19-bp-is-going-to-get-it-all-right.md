To me human race looked so talented and capable until it all came down rumbling with BP unleasing its disaster. With all the magnificent skyscrapers, wind mills, bridges, dams and space programs, mankind had really made an impression on me that we are the best. 

Really struck hard with the gulf oil disaster. What did the best engineering minds do to promptly shut off the oil flow into to pristine waters? How stupid is it to not have multiple failsafe backup mechanism to prevent such an outcome. Was is so difficult to place a simple failsafe mechanism to lock the flow of water once the base station up there is in some kind of trouble. 

All seems so obvious to me and yet difficult for the BP officials to clean the mess up. Come on people, how hard is it to have an automated mechanism shut things off the moment it feels something wasn&#8217;t quite right. How ridiculous does that sound. I am now aware that we are not the best engineering minds who couldn&#8217;t even forsee such a scenario and prepare a backup plan ahead of time.
