If you remember one thing and one thing only in designing your e-Commerce Web site, remember the fastest way to drive a customer away from your site is to confront him with a lot of flashy animation, slick Java applets, or require plug-ins to view your site. Even if you include all the proper Web site essentials to your online store, they will be all for nothing when your customers are driven away in the first few seconds of their visit.

So, before you design your site, keep this in mind. There are millions and millions of potential customers who are still cruising the Web at 28.8Kbps “Kbps stands for kilobytes per second, the amount of bytes of data that a modem can send in a second.” Design your site with them in mind. All that work you did in finding and choosing a good Web hosting provider with a fast connection to the Web will be irrelevant if you design a technology blotted site that takes the average Web surfer several minutes to download.

Forget all the fancy stuff. Forget streaming video, animation, and live audio. Keep your site simple and make it load fast. You only have a few seconds to grab a shopper&#8217;s attention.
