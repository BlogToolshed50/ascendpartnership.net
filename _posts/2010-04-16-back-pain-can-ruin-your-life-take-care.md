Are back problems due to lack of being conscious about your posture, are they due to bad sitting positions or diet? Well these are certain question that keeps haunting people. According to a statistics by WebMD, almost 80% of American suffers form back problems at least at some point of their lives. Back pain problems can be primarily attributed to the bad sitting positions and the hectic life that one leads. With computers being widely used, most people tend to concentrate on their work while sitting in a posture that does not really help them be comfortable. Unusual levels of stress on the spinal cords can lead to back pains. If not treated on time these issues can grow very bad causing serious health issues in the later times of one&#8217;s life.
