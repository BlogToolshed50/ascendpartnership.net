I really like to make sure that all of our Christmas decorations in our home don&#8217;t look too flashy. I go for more of the minimalist home decor look anyway and I like to keep with that even around the holidays. I&#8217;m not a scrooge or anything. We do have quite a few decorations. It&#8217;s just that I like to keep them a little understated looking.

I find that the rustic look is really great for this because it&#8217;s a little interesting yet understated. I was trying to get some ideas for some new decorations a few days ago and when I was doing that I came across the website &nbsp;http://www.Getclearwirelessinternet.com&nbsp; and actually switched over our home internet access to it.

I found this really &nbsp;wood block snowman&nbsp; craft, along with directions, and thought that it would fit in perfectly with the rest of our decorations. I&#8217;m gong to put it in a table in our entrance hall to our house. I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out something to put there for a while now and I think this will be perfect for it.
