Most people find that these instructions sound clear and easy to do, but that in practice, the awareness easily slips away as we begin to daydream and compulsively entertain various thoughts. This is merely habitual and is not considered to be a bad thing at all: in fact this habitual mind is the very handle with which we can get a hold on the entire process of seeing the unconditional, clear and open mind.So, some of the mediation tips are as follows.

The moment you know that you have returned from a distracting thought, apply the mental label ‘thinking’ and return your awareness to your breathing. As you begin your awareness meditation, you will become aware of the many waves of thought that come up and disappear endlessly. This is totally natural and occurs to everyone, but it is how we regard this process that is the difference between whether or not we suffer from it.

Try to maintain this awareness of awareness for a short period, perhaps just for a minute. Then, just let that drop, and take a break. A break in this case does not necessarily mean standing up or even moving your body at all. It just means to drop the meditation exercise for a time. Stretching and another deep breath or two can be helpful before you begin another short ‘session’.

All that occurs to your mind is simply an occurrence of mind. It is important to take frequent breaks from the technique. One of the best Mediation Tips.

Spend some time simply feeling your body as you breathe in and out.
  
The essence of this awareness meditation is training your mind in the ability to let go: allowing whatever arises within your mind to simply arise without blocking or grasping at what occurs— just to remain aware and awake for the given period of time that you have decided to practice.

We like pleasure and dislike pain, we tend to react to what we perceive and think with acceptance and rejection. The unseen habitual patterns of clinging to what we like and wanting to eliminate what we do not like entangle us in an unending struggle in our everyday lives and cause us unnecessary pain.

Giving rise to awareness of habitual patterns can be uncomfortable at first, but we quickly begin to see how much of life we have been missing and our daily experience naturally becomes more brilliant and enjoyable as we learn to allow a natural flow to occur.
