I studied about the concept of float in my project management class. I am not really into management and the like, but I really enjoyed the concepts that I studied in the course. Float concept comes in the planning phase of a project. A float is defined as the amount of time an activity may be delayed from its early start without delaying the finish of the project. Float is a mathematical calculation and can change as the project progresses and changes are made in the project plan (Pinto, Project Management, p.284).

Float = Late Start date (LS) &#8211; Early Start date (ES)

I just realized that I am implementing the concept of float every morning (to be on a safer side). I am an utter sleepy head and it takes quite an effort for any alarm to wake me up. So what I do is, I set up the time that I wish to wake up in my cell phone, so that I can get ready in a relaxed manner and the time that I have to wake up absolutely (otherwise, I will miss the bus) in my little loud alarm time piece. For example, if I need to catch the 10:00 am bus, the alarm time that I set on my cell phone is 8:30 am (early start) and the time that I set on my timepiece is 9 am (late start). I chose my loud alarm piece as my device for late start as it wouldn&#8217;t go off as opposed to the cell phone, which when you press the wrong button in your sleep, goes off. The float time that I am assigning here is half an hour. This is pretty good a practice to keep in check my over-sleeping, otherwise which I tend to miss my classes.

It feels good to relate the principles that you study in your course to your day-to-day activities.
