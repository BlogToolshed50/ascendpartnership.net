Are you making a living or living your life? To &#8220;live&#8221; your life implies action&#8211;movement&#8211;excitement. Unfortunately, today most of us have our calendars so full we have little time to enjoy all the courses in the feast of life. It&#8217;s important that you value your precious time here on this planet.

Most of us believe that the hand we are dealt in life is what we will always hold. Sure, life is okay but it isn&#8217;t great; bills need to be paid, the kids are sick, and the bank account never seems to grow. After some time, you believe this is your life and how it will always play out. On the other hand, people who believe they deserve better play a different hand and they never have a poker face when it comes to their expectations.

When you expect only the best, you put yourself in a position of power. First and foremost, you send signals to your subconscious to help you notice and get what you desire (and deserve!).You get a check in the mail or you literally bump into the perfect woman at the coffee shop and she happens to live close by. Great expectations lead to great results.

Like every play, your life has its own story. Learn from the past but don&#8217;t get caught up in it. You can&#8217;t change it and you can&#8217;t expect or anticipate anything that has already taken place! And you don&#8217;t really know how it&#8217;s going to end, or even what&#8217;s coming up next. The best thing you can do is keep up with what&#8217;s going on and steer it in the direction you would like it to go. The rest will play out as it will.

In the morning, do not get out of bed until you sit back, fluff your pillows and fill yourself with words of loving encouragement and expectation. Ponder the words, let them sink in. Imagine the dreams you have for yourself. And finish by including a short proclamation for your day to be full of wonder, joy and guidance.

Listen to your intuition, for it is your best friend. Ignore your fears for they are definitely not in your best interest. Believe in your dreams for they are your future. Come to expect success in your life and everything you do, because you are constantly preparing for it. Expect the best out of life and you will get it!

Expect the best and the best will come&#8230;
