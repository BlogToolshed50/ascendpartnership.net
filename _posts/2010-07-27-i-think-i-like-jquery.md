Internet application development has changes a whole bunch since the time I started following them. Currently its the AJAX era of internet development. Everyone wants to show off their ajax work. It was really amazing how yahoo mail switched to ajax when google first brought the technology with their mail service. It was at times like, yahoo was overdoing the ajax part in their mail application. 

I was not so much fascinated about what yahoo did with their mail service. But I do believe its nice to use now than before. Today I read that yahoo japan is merging with google. Yahoo currently holds 56% market share ahead of googles 31%. yet I believe yahoo japan just wants to yield as it soon might be overrun by the search giant. Rather succumb to the enemy than get crushed !! Lets see how things unroll in the days to come.
