I took up recreational &nbsp;rock climbing&nbsp; a few years into retirement. However, I really just stick to indoor climbing ones because I prefer the indoors, in general.

My son actually is an instructor at a local &nbsp;gym&nbsp; and he helped me get practice and get certified. I always thought it was a little crazy that people would just want to climb things but once he started doing it in college I supported him.

For my 60th birthday he told me that he would teach me how to climb if I wanted. I took him up on the offer and started out really slow. I was afraid that I wasn’t in good enough physical shape to handle it but he reassured me and surprisingly, he was right!

But I was having one problem because of my age. I was having trouble hearing him tell me what I should do next and tips as I was climbing on the wall. So I did what I was considering for a long time, bought &nbsp;Hearing Aids by Miracle Ear&nbsp;.

I still haven’t climbed anywhere outside of the wall in my son’s gym but I really am enjoying this new activity.
