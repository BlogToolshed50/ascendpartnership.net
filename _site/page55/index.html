    <p>Guest post written by Kari Lamb</p>

<p>OK, I guess there’s really no good time for the air conditioning unit to break – except maybe during a blizzard – but this was an exceptionally bad time because our house is currently on the market. My job is taking me across the state and although commuting every day sounded like a good option, it just wasn’t a realistic or financially sound idea.</p>

<p>Our house was immaculate once the real estate agent staked the FOR SALE sign down in our yard. But then a week and a half later, right in the middle of June, our cooling unit stopped working. We called up the hvac pros sears because some former clients of hers had a good experience with them when they were in the same situation.</p>

<p>We called them up immediately and got a decent estimate that we thought would be worth it considering we were trying to sell our house as soon as possible. The new unit was installed really quickly and the next week our house was sold. I was sad to leave our home, but our house in my new location is a little larger and has a bigger yard!</p>

  </header>

    <p>Entering the stock market can be daunting and new traders are often advised to have a trading plan. An oft-repeated saying is that ninety percent of all stock traders fail and the remaining ten percent all have trading plans. It’s not exactly provable but this should show you how highly regarded trading plans are. A good trading plan can help you through the rough spots when you’re trading on the stock market and this means you should try your best to formulate a good one and to stick to it consistently.</p>

<p>So how do we formulate this almighty trading plan then? Well, you should start by assessing yourself. This is simple because a trading plan is more than just any vague idea of how you should behave in the market – it’s pretty much a program of how you will behave in the market. There’s a very thin difference but that difference can mean the loss of thousand of your dollars or you hitting the mother lode. Knowing exactly what you can do and what your mental state is imperative.</p>

<p>A trading plan sets the risk level that you want to go and it can be nerve-shattering sometimes when you see a deal that your trading plan won’t let you take. Knowing how you will respond and how fast you can respond to the sudden changes in the stock market is important. This will determine how you should shape your trading plan. If your personality is that of a natural risk-taker and you have the deep pockets to back this up in the market, your trading plan should reflect this.However, if you have a more conservative outlook and don’t have much money, a less daredevil trading plan would probably be more appropriate</p>

  </header>

    <p>You may have personally experienced, or just heard from other people, of the mental boost that they get from smoking. Perhaps, for a short period of time such boost may be true, however in the long run, the effect of the tobacco consumption may be more dangerous to your brain than what you have expected. If you want to better your brain’s well-being, you have to worry about what affects your IQ.</p>

<p>An Addiction Research Center conducted a research regarding the long-term effects of alcohol on an alcoholic’s brain functioning. As expected, alcohol was found to be associated with mental problems and lower IQ scores. And as an addition to their findings, they also found out that long-term smoking has an effect on decreased brain power.</p>

<p>The results showed that alcohol has more severe effects on the thinking skills of alcoholic men who have been smoking for quite some time already. It has an adverse effect on memory, problem-solving skills and even the IQ of these men.</p>

<p>Among these alcoholic subjects, cigarette smoking was seen to be related to reduced mental functioning. However, even though the cause and effect relationship between smoking and the decreased mental performance was not clearly established, there are still some things which point out to the fact that cigarettes are the cause to such effect. In order to prove this point, more studies will have to be conducted.</p>

<p>Aside from these bad vices, there are still other things which may cause the reduction of your brain power.</p>

    <p>This guest post from Errol Chang</p>

<p>direct tv, i can’t look away. I am transported into a half hour of the casts’ amusing banter.</p>

<p>The show is about Ted Mosby, a hip and hopelessly romantic protagonist, and his group of twenty something friends and their engaging lives in NYC. Every character, from the extremely Canadian Robin Scherbatsky, to the womanizing, suit wearing, hilarity that is Barney Stinson. Then there’s the adorable perfect couple that is Marshall and Lily, they all have their distinct place in making this ensemble work. Besides being incredibly likeable, the show manages to be unpretentious and really relatable. Barney is responsible for many of the ‘LOL’ moments of the series, but it’s Ted’s continuous search for love, that is the real highlight of the show. Ted’s everlong stumbling through the maze of serial dating in search of a future wife, is told pretty poignantly through narration. He keeps his heart on his sleeve, and his friends near and dear. So i keep rooting for the good guy, watching, and loving this show. No matter how far off he is from ever meeting ‘Mrs. Right’.</p>
