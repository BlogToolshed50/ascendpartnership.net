    <p>When students at Mira Loma High School in Sacramento, California return to school at the end of this month, they will have more to look forward to than homework. They will have the opportunity to experience science hands on: they can participate in the Arcade Creek Project.</p>

<p>Designed as a facet of Mira Lomas participation in the International Baccalaureate Program (one of sixty schools nationwide with such distinction), five instructors created the student run project to meet the discipline requirements for science and chemistry. Students in the program are required to spend a minimum of forty hours per school year in the field counting birds and fish, mapping bends in the creek, calculating the slopes of riverbanks, analyzing water samples, and generally enjoying the great outdoors that is as long as your idea of a good time in the great outdoors involves wearing waders and carrying a clipboard.</p>

<p>The Arcade Creek Project consists of eleven individual studies that take place in randomly selected sites along the creek which is located just north of the campus in a suburban area of Sacramento County. The studies measure and map the physical dimensions of the creek, determine the degree of erosion along the banks, analyze the water quality, and count species of animals to gauge the health of the creek. Students also remove trash and non-native plants from the creek. They plan to begin reintroducing native plants soon. This active observation of the local land feature has fostered a deep affection for the little creek, an affection that has even moved the students to political activism. When another community group tried to purchase some of the land near the creek to build a parking lot, the students organized a letter writing campaign to put a stop to the development. So far the campaign can be considered a success; the plans for the parking lot have been put on permanent hold.</p>

<p>Another branch project encourages students to reach out to their community by participating in Creek Week and the Sacramento Urban Creek Council to help their community recognize the importance of the creek and the role it plays in the health of the ecosystem and community overall. Students in the outreach program visit local elementary and middle schools to raise awareness of the need to protect the environment and have even developed class material for local elementary school students. Their textbook? The Lorax, by Dr. Seuss.</p>

<p>In 2004, the project was awarded the Governor’s Environmental and Economic Leadership Award for Children’s Environmental Education by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now entering its ninth year, the Arcade Creek Project hopes to continue to inspire the students of Mira Loma’s IB Program and the residents of their community to protect their local environment.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2013/07/02/modern-business-strategies-and-tactics-2/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Modern business strategies and tactics</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Modern business strategies and tactics often concentrate on developing international brands and products, but before developing any product it is important to assess the potential worldwide demand. While most companies do consider this aspect while developing a new product or brand, some companies concentrate on just getting worldwide acclaim and ubiquitous recognition. The result can be customer disappointment when the actual product fails to live up to the hype and disappointing sales.</p>

<p>Companies in the manufacturing and service sectors have realized that to achieve economies of scale they need to formulate management policies based on modern business strategies. Being able to sell the same product or market the same brand at the global level helps to increase the efficiency of their related industrial activities such as product packaging, graphics and advertising. They also gain all of the benefits that are derived from the use of common technology, product specifications, and raw materials. However, being actually able to maintain such global presence in a diverse world is much easier said than done. The simplest solution that companies have is to recognize common product preferences in different countries and make minor changes to the fundamental product design. This is the best way of optimizing their product or service for both the worldwide and local market at the same time. Modern business strategies are also associated with effective management of capital flows, human resources and other factors of production.</p>

<p>The use of information technology in almost every type of industrial process has contributed to the development of modern business strategies and tactics. With the aid of the Internet, information related to any new idea or design is distributed all over the world very quickly. This is why modern business strategies that support product development or facilities development have to move at a much faster speed than ever before. Any business strategy or tactic that is not up-to-date will prove ineffective when it comes to achieving departmental and organizational targets.</p>

<p>Modern business strategies lay stress on using the latest communication tools such as video conferencing and e-mail for improving communication within the organization as well as with clients. Project management techniques used in some of the biggest multinational companies such as Sony, Intel, Microsoft, Time and others are based on such modern business strategies. With multi-billion dollar mergers becoming a norm, companies are concentrating on formulating innovative strategies rather than just concentrating on established management techniques. Organizations such as Glaxo-Welcome and Merck, who have grown through mergers and acquisitions, have reorganized their international product lines with the help of modern business strategies and techniques.</p>

<p>With the help of modern procurement strategies, global giants have managed to build and operate production centers in international locations at the least possible cost and in minimal time. If modern business strategies are implemented properly, they can easily accommodate for the diversity that exists between countries. These can be used to develop innovative project management methods that can help achieve greater uniformity and economies of scale across the business. They encourage knowledge-based innovation and help develop the ability to execute on commitments and deliver higher standards of customer satisfaction. Modern business strategies revolve around producing and marketing international products and brands that are then tailored to local markets. As such, in today’s world of globalization, the concept of localization has become inherent in almost all modern business strategies.</p>

  </header>

    <p>If you are like most time share owners, you’ve already discovered that your “great deal,” according to an enthusiastic time share sales representative, wasn’t so great after all. Maintenance fees, condo fees, mortgage payments and horrible resale values has made time share ownership for most people more of a headache than anything else.</p>

<p>It’s no wonder that terms like “time share resale” and “sell time share” are the most frequently searched terms related to time shares on Yahoo.com. Just enter “timeshares” at inventory.overture.com and see for yourself.</p>

<p>These negatives do not change the fact that a luxury timeshare resort is a wonderful place to spend a vacation. I would choose a luxury resort over a luxury hotel any time.</p>

<p>The big players and developers in the time share industry have wised up, and are now spending more energy on lifetime discount travel packages.</p>

<p>Lifetime discount travel packages have been sold at many resorts over the last 20 years as a time share presentation exit product. That is, customers that refuse to yield to the high pressure time share sales team are offered a lifetime discount travel package instead.</p>

<p>These travel packages represent a much better deal, because users have the option of staying at a wider variety of luxury resorts without the high time share costs of maintenance fees, taxes, mortgage payments and RCI exchange fees.</p>

<p>In fact, there are no maintenance fees, taxes, exchange fees or mortgage payments with lifetime discount travel packages at all. Once you own a membership, you can simply book a luxury resort or hotel for as little as $298 per week. These are the same luxury resorts you would find on Expedia, Travelocity and Priceline for any where from $1,400 to $3,000 per week.</p>

<p>For example, one of the most popular and luxurious Florida time share properties is the Star Island Resort and Club in Kissimmee. Renting a week at this luxury resort would easily run upwards of $1,800.</p>

<p>However, membership in a discount travel plan can knock the price down to $300 or $700 for the same week. Don’t let the low price fool you. These are luxury suites with no time share presentation requirements attached.</p>

<p>Do you see why lifetime discount travel packages are time share presentation exit products? These are literally the last thing a time share sales force would want you to know about. They are, in fact, the best kept secret in the time share industry.</p>

<p>It just makes good sense; Don’t buy a time share; just buy a week or two at a luxury resort on an ‘as needed’ basis with a lifetime discount travel package. If you don’t travel in a particular year, you pay nothing. Additionally, there are no black out weeks or RCI exchange fees involved.</p>

<p>If you own a time share, you are still responsible for maintenance fees, taxes and mortgage payments each and every year, including the years when you don’t travel. That just doesn’t seem fair.</p>

<p>When you do the math, the difference in ownership costs between a lifetime discount travel package and a time share purchase is staggering. So don’t buy a time share! There is a better way.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Every garden is the end result of four basic steps: Planning, Preparation, Planting and Maintenance. These four steps can be as simple or as complicated as the gardener chooses to make them.</p>

<p>Gardeners who want a small and simple cutting garden will use the same steps as gardeners who want a large and elaborate series of gardens.</p>

<p>Planning</p>

<p>Plan where you want to put your garden, checking carefully for sun exposure. Know how much sun the plants you want to grow need and how much water they will need.</p>

<p>Know how much sun the plants you want to grow need and how much water they will need. Make sure you do not place plants with heavy water requirements next to plants that like dry conditions.</p>

<p>Preparation</p>

<p>Your soil is the foundation of your garden. Give your plants the best foundation possible by preparing your garden spot in three simple steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Remove all grass and weeds from your chosen gardening spot</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Till the soil, removing stones and breaking up large clods of earth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amend or improve the soil.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Planting</p>

<p>Sketch a rough drawing of what you want your completed garden to look like and follow through with planting seeds and established plants according to your plan.</p>

<p>Guard against late spring freezes and give your new seedlings and plants plenty of water to give them a good, healthy start.</p>

<p>Maintenance</p>

<p>Maintain your garden simply and easily with consistent attention to weeding and watering. Feed your plants well but don’t over feed them. Deadhead your flowers to encourage re-blooming and to keep plants from expending energy on seed production. Be prepared for the onslaught of destructive insects and take steps to control the damage.</p>

<p>By following these important and simple steps you will be on your way to a successful garden.</p>

  </header>

    <p>“The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear.”</p>

<p>H.P. Lovecraft</p>

<p>Fear is defined as an emotional response to an unknown or impending danger or as an expectation of evil. Fear can create feelings of apprehension, anxiety, alarm, dread, fright or terror. When you are in fear, you are scared of someone, something or a potential outcome.</p>

<p>We all experience fear at one point in time or another. Actually fear is a great way to keep us from hurting ourselves. Fear has a limiting effect on our behaviors and ourselves. Fear keeps us from putting our hand on the hot burner of the stove. It keeps us from jumping from high place, or leaves us tentative when going into a darkened room. These types of fears are good. They keep us safe. They make us think before we do, knowing full well the potential outcome and repercussions of our actions. Even with activities such as fire walking, skydiving and bunji jumping, a major component or should I say thrill of these activities is saying hello to and overcoming fear.</p>

<p>Fear comes in all shapes and sizes. In extreme cases individuals find themselves afraid of closed in spaces such as elevators. They may be afraid of insects such as spiders or bees, they may be afraid of heights, afraid to fly in airplanes or even afraid of the water. Fear is elicited as a response or reaction to some previous life experience or trauma. It can be experienced when we look to venture into uncharted ground, especially when the outcome is unknown. We can also experience fear when we loose our jobs, look to end a relationship or even when we try to express our needs and desires.</p>

<p>Fear can impact us in many ways. It was once said “Fear is the thief of dreams”. The truth to that statement is unbelievable. Bottom line … fear takes away our choices. It can keep us from doing the things we want or need to do for ourselves. It limits us, constrains us and can end up ruling our lives. It consumes our energy and enjoyment of life, leaving us experiencing additional unexplainable stress, frustration or feeling just plain stuck.</p>

<p>When it comes to health, the role emotions, especially the emotion of fear is not something to be taken lightly. Fear causes the body to contract. Fear causes our life force energy, or chi’, that flows through our bodies to slow down creating distortions in its flow. The impact or sizes of these energetic distortions are dictated by repetition, intensity and our reaction to the negative/fear causing factor. These energetic distortions can be likened to an imaginary button within ourselves. The impact or size of these distortions being equated to how many times or how hard the button(s) gets pushed, multiplied by our unique reaction to the event or situation. It is like finding out that you owe the IRS money. Some people take it in stride, with little to no reaction. In others, it may evoke an intense reaction – one that will be remembered for years.</p>

<p>As these energetic distortions grow, our life force energy slows down proportionately, until it finally stops.</p>

<p>Once stopped, disease is only a step away. When we are in fear, we are hesitant to take steps forward. Our minds are filled with thoughts of a traumatic experience, a negative outcome or the potential repercussions of our choices and decisions. We manifest these fears as procrastination, where we choose to do nothing. Sometimes we go into resistance, digging our heals in and holding on tightly to our current position or situation. Some of us go into denial about our fears, choosing to blame others or the situation for their choices. Others just avoid putting themselves into scary situations thus eliminating any possible threat.</p>

<p>Being in or living in fear is all about choices…you can choose to move forward, or you can choose to stand still marking time. Again, while some fears are good and essential for our basic survival, many of the ones we face daily have nothing to do with any real threat or danger. For many of us, the only real peril we experience are the thoughts and ideas we conger up in our minds.</p>

<p>Fear can be thought of as a scary old-time black and white movie poster of the Werewolf or Dracula hanging on the back of a door in a darkened room. As we look ahead, the only thing we can see is this scary creature obstructing our passage and forward movement. What we don’t realize is that the threat isn’t real. Once we turn on the lights in the room, we can see that it is only a poster and no danger at all.</p>

<p>What’s more, as we sit in this darkened room, unable or unwilling to either turn on the lights or step through that door, we will never know what is on the other side. We will be forever trapped by our own reservations, worries and uncertainties and will never come to know the freedom and sense of power that is experienced as you step through its limitation and into the light of a new day. Addressing fear, saying hello to it, is a major component in overcoming it. It is like turning on the light in that darkened room, the unknowns become known, what was once scary becomes mundane and may even seem trivial.</p>

<p>Miraculous things happen to those who consciously choose to overcome their fears. As they begin to move forward in this new life journey, many find deep, long lost, feelings of inner strength and renewed self-confidence. They gain certainty in their skills, abilities and even downfalls. They have the good fortune of learning more about themselves, their wants, needs and desires, thus opening new doors of opportunity and enjoyment.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Attracting new customers who will buy your products and services is one of the most important goals of a business – more so for a start up business. There are many different methods that you can use to entice customers and attract their attention. But one of the best ways of doing this is to use tried and tested public relations skills. PR can give some excellent results for your online company formation with the added benefit of using very little financial resources.</p>

<p>Public relations (PR) is, quite simply, the relationship your business has with the public. The kind of relationship you will establish with your public is bound to have a significant effect on the future of your business. This is where public relations can help. PR is when you publicize and build interest and enthusiasm for your business among your public. Successfully doing this would create more awareness for your business and its products and services as well as driving sales.</p>

<p>Following are tips that would help you make effective PR efforts</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Before you start planning any PR efforts make sure that your product or service is ready. Ensure that your product is primed for public consumption. Bring it out, make sure it works and that it does something that people will care about. Because PR drives customer demand, you will miss out on important sales or even drive your customers away and to your competitors if they do come to you and your products are not ready.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must get to know your market. A successful PR thrust is based on reaching the right audience with a message that is appropriate and meaningful to them. If you are not familiar with your target audience as well as the publications that they read, chances are, implementing the rest of your PR actions will be completely useless. There would be no point of trying to get your story printed in a financial paper when your audience primarily reads the regular dailies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should learn all about the media to more effectively target your efforts. When you define your audience you will also have to know their reading habits (what publications do they read), the radio programs that they listen to, the TV programs that they watch as well as the websites that they visit. Take the time to familiarize yourself with the media outlets that you plan to target. You will need to get a good idea of that type of stories that you will need to present to optimize your chance of coverage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most integral part of your PR campaign is your message so make sure that it is clear, concise and brief. If you cannot sum up your message in a few sentences then it is too complicated and editors won’t probably read it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
