  </header>

    <p>Who is more prone to become affected by or suffer from psychological problems? the answer nearly everyone. Depression in the United States alone has left its mark on at least 17 million adults who have experienced a bout of clinical depression at some stage. Suffering from this disorder can interrupt any plans a person may have on leading a normal life. (Depending how serious the symptoms for each patient) depression affects us all in different ways some cases more severe than others.</p>

<p>Serious depression needs nurturing and this can be done with medical help</p>

<p>What to expect if depression takes hold, well it can cause unbearable pain emotionally also expect your life to turn upside down if the depression escalates out of control. You are not on your own if you have been diagnosed with depression people around you feel your pain also therefore affected too.</p>

<p>Similar is bipolar disorder which is another form of depression. Bipolar was once named manic-depressive disorder, mood swings that came with bipolar differed in many ways, one being is the manic highs which were noted as a high risk factor for self inflicted harm to the patient.</p>

<p>Without doubt a patients thoughts and feelings change dramatically if in possession of this psychological condition. Depression has often been mistaken with the feeling of sadness or lethargic bouts; these common symptoms do not necessarily mean this is depression they relate more to every day stress.</p>

<p>Stress normally withers away after a few days but if you find you are still saddened and the fatigue factor still strong and there is no sign of these symptoms easing up then seek medical help as it could be the start of depression</p>

<p>Unfortunately in some cases depression goes unnoticed and because of this approx two thirds of depressed patients are not receiving the right medication or treatment. Sadly this is an unfortunate predicament because with the right medical treatment approx 80% of depression sufferers will have found light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>Depression has been known to take lives; patients struggle to adjust to their new found way of life living with a burden that some believe are with them till eternity, a similar feeling to having a Siamese twin attached till death do us part. Well now we have modern medicines in a modern world that can help you in your separation from depression which has driven you to take on a false identity where the laughing on the outside is overpowered by all the crying within.</p>

<p>Just like the Siamese twins medics have now proven that with the right medical treatment they can UN-attach the attached.</p>

<p>Talk to someone if you have reason for concern on your health or that of someone close and let those with the knowledge on depression help you in your quest to lead a normal life once again.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Life with stress and life without stress- they are poles apart!</p>

<p>Some types of stress are inevitable. Some stresses are those over which you have no control. Plus, some one may be the cause of your stress; there are some types of stress of which you are the cause, and therefore you have to find its solution.</p>

<p>Mostly, the level of your stress and the level of your heartbeat go hand in hand. The greater the pounding, more intense is the level of the pressure. Nobody is happy to own the stress permanently. Hence, arises the question of managing the stress.</p>

<p>The causes of stress are innumerable. May be that it concerns your children, or the usual, unusual arguments with your spouse. A word of caution to the heart patients. Develop the trait of patience and avoid stress at all costs. Stress is the cause of many heart attacks.</p>

<p>Remember the cop managing the heavy traffic in a busy junction-he is the master of traffic rules, he has the assistance of red, yellow and green signals. He regulates, controls the rush of a large number of vehicles, with the assistance of these signals.</p>

<p>So, coping stress is all about stress management. Nobody likes to remain in a state of stress. But the style of life in the modern materialistic civilization, throws many types of stresses, without your asking for it. Rather, stress is forced upon you! Managing the stress assumes added importance here. Some of the following guidelines may help you in manging the stress:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Do not suppress your stress. Only you know the reason of your stress. Discuss your difficulties with your trusted ones, friends, relatives or with your spouse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do some deep breathing exercises, for 10-15 minutes everyday, sitting all alone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything in the world is happening as it should. You are not the one to create all the problems or to solve all the problems. The perfect order or discipline that you want might not be available at all times. Carry on them, with the available discipline.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Temper is very valuable. Do not lose it. But if you are determined to lose it, do not respond to anyone at a high temperature level. Let things cool down. Time provides its own answers, for major part of your problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think of the positive side of the issue. The strength of the negative side, will then automatically weaken.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes, a spiritual personality can help you more, for sure, than your psychologist or family doctor. Do not hesitate to surrender before the Perfect Master. He may bestow you with such grace, bless you with such positive thoughts that your stress may just float away, destination less and direction less never to return again.</p>

<p>Yes, this is not a vague assumption. This stress, could be your blessing in disguise!</p>
