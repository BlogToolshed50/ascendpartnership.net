  </header>

    <p>This guest post from Edgardo Rosa</p>

<p>It has been over a decade since the Denver Broncos wont back to back Super Bowls. Since John Elway left it has not been the same in the Mile High city. Sure we had Jake Plummer and Jay Cutler, but no one with the winning ways of Elway has graced the city. We always get off to these hot starts and then fade away down the stretch.</p>

<p>Denver has to get back to running the football and playing good defense. Easier said than done, but the defense has not been good, except for the first 6 games last year. Maybe with Tim Tebow competing for the starting job there will be some excitement in the air. I am not saying he is the greatest thing in the world, but maybe he could give a little boost for 5 – 10 plays per game.</p>

<p>I moved from the city 4 years ago so I have to watch the games on John Elway and those Super Bowl champions.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Posted by Jerold Austin</p>

<p>It is hard to believe that it is time to go shopping for back to school supplies. Every year I try to find the places that offer discounts and coupons to help purchase the supplies that are needed. This year we have decided to do our shopping the Friday before school starts. Saturdays are way too busy. We will leave early Friday morning to go have door alarm before going shopping. Times are rough and it seems that houses are broken into during this time of year.</p>

<p>We will be shopping for shorts, shirts, underwear, socks and shoes. My 5 year old will need a mat for nap time at school. The school has given us a list for hand sanitizer, paper towels, lotion, anti-bacterial soap, crayons, scissors, glue, pencils, and kleenex tissues. This is for the entire class to use through out the year. I will shop at Walgreen’s also because they have great deals on these types of items. My 9 year old will need a graphing calculator this year. I will also buy book bags, note book paper, note books, and ink pens. This will get the school year started.</p>
