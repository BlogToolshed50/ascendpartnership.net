  </header>

    <p>In the past, if you mentioned the word “infrastructure”, the verbal reflex would be: “physical”. Infrastructure was roads, telephone lines, ports, airports and other very tangible country spanning things. Many things were added to this category as time went by, but they all preserved the tangibility requirements – even electricity and means of communication were measured by their physical manifestations: lines, poles, distances.</p>

<p>Today, we distinguish three additional categories of infrastructure which were unbeknownst to our forefathers:</p>

<p>Social infrastructure – laws, social institutions and agencies, social stratification, demographic elements and other social structures, formal and informal.</p>

<p>It is amazing to think that previously no one thought of the legal codex as infrastructure. It has all the hallmarks of infrastructure: it spans all the country, it dynamically develops on the basis of a previous strata, without it no goal oriented human activity (such as the conduct of business) is possible. A foreign investors is more interested in the answer to the question whether his property rights are protected under the law – than in the availability and accessibility of electricity lines.</p>

<p>He can always buy a generator and produce his own electricity – but he can never enact his own laws unilaterally. A local citizen is bound to encounter the law (or resort to it) sometime in his life – even if he never travels a road or uses a telephone.</p>

<p>The second category of infrastructure is the human infrastructure. What is the mentality of the people? Are they lazy, industrious, submissive, used to improvise, work in groups, individuals, rebellious, inventive or stifled and so on? Are they conservative, open to the world, xenophobic, ethnically radicalized, likely to use brute force to settle disputes? Are they ignorant, educated, technologically oriented, consume information or reject it, trustful and trustworthy or suspicious and resentful?</p>

<p>An educated workforce is as much an infrastructure as any phone line.</p>

<p>The last category of infrastructure is the information infrastructure. It is all the infrastructure which tackles the manipulation of symbols of all kinds : the accumulation of data, it processing and its dissemination. Words are symbols – but so is money and computer bytes. So banks, computers, Internet linkups, WANs and LANs (Wide and local area computer networks), standardized accounting, other standards for gods and services – all these are examples of the information infrastructure.</p>

<p>The development of all these infrastructures is intimately linked. They usually develop almost concurrently. They form feedback loops. The slow or hindered development of one of them will disturb all the others.</p>

<p>This is really quite easy to understand. If the workforce is not educated, it will not be keen on the manipulation of data and symbols. It will buy less computers, use the Internet less, bank less and so on. This, in turn, will reduce the need for phone lines, office buildings and so on. There seems to be an “infrastructure multiplier”.</p>

<p>This multiplier is a two way street: an increase or decrease in each type of infrastructure adversely or positively influences the others.</p>

<p>The West is in dire need of infrastructure itself. Its infrastructure is either old and crumbling – or overloaded and crumbling. Roads in large parts of the USA are in poorer condition than roads in many countries in Africa. America-On-Line, a major Internet provider was unable to provide services to its customers in the last few weeks because communication lines in the USA were totally blocked. Certain places in Israel could receive television signals only in the last few years, as infrastructure reached them. Infrastructure is a universal problem.</p>

<p>No surprise that the West invests in the infrastructure in developing countries in two venues only:</p>

<p>Through international finance organizations (such as the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development). The terms and conditions of this kind of financing are very lenient. Those are really grants more than credits.</p>

<p>The implementation of these infrastructural projects is awarded to contractors through international tenders, wherein bids are submitted from the world over.</p>

<p>Rarely, a local firm outbids its better financed, better equipped and better motivated first world rivals. Local firms usually have the lower hand.</p>

<p>The other possibility is that multinational firms get involved. But this kind of financing comes with a lot of strings attached. The multinationals expect to get back both their investment and a reasonable return on it. They come heavily subsidized by the governments of their countries. Their contribution to the local economy, during the construction of the infrastructure, is fleeting, at best. They prefer to employ their own crews and equipment. They do not trust the locals too much or too often.</p>

<p>But whichever way the infrastructure is created, problems arise to the host country.</p>

<p>International, multilateral, finance organizations inevitably think on a global scale.</p>

<p>They invest in infrastructure only if and when it services – or has the potential to service in the larger scheme of things – a cluster of neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>Clear benefits to regional groupings of countries has to be unequivocally demonstrated. Such finance organizations will forever prefer to invest in a cross-border highway. They will neglect, overlook, or outrightly reject an investment in a much needed local road, for instance. The benefit to the domestic economy of the local road could be appreciatively more sizeable. Still, the international fund would encourage the cross border highway. This is its charter – to promote multilateral investments – and this is what it does best. The interests of the host country are a secondary consideration.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the private sector invests only in countries with well developed infrastructure in all the aforementioned categories. That this is a tautology, no one seems to notice. If the infrastructure is already developed – an investment is not needed. When it is needed, the private sector will not supply it, unless it is already developed. The result is that proper investments of the private sector – not subsidized, not partial, not correlated by international funding – is limited to the developed, industrial world.</p>

<p>Research discovered four disadvantages of countries with under-developed infrastructure:</p>

<p>Such countries suffer from interminable bottlenecks in all the levels of economic activity, especially in the production phase and in the transportation of raw materials to the factories and of finished products from them to the marketplace.</p>

<p>This adversely affects the availability of the domestic product both in the domestic and in the foreign markets. Agricultural produce is most affected but, to a lesser extent, so are industrial goods. If the infrastructural problem is with lines of communication, the service sector is harmed and cannot provide its products (the services) to its customers.</p>

<p>A second issue is the distortion of the price mechanism. Prices are heightened due to the resources wasted on trying to overcome problems in infrastructure. Prices are supposed to reflect inputs and values and thus to assist the markets to optimally allocate its resources. If the prices reflect other, unrelated, issues – then they are distorted and they distort the economic activity.</p>

<p>The third problem is that a disadvantage of a country – is an advantage to its competitors, rivals, neighbors and enemies. Other countries, with better infrastructure benefit : they attract more foreign investment, they conduct more business, they export more, they have lower inflation (cheaper prices) and their economy is not distorted by irrelevant, ulterior, non business considerations.</p>

<p>The fourth – and maybe largest and longest term – handicap is when the country’s image is affected. Infrastructure is much easier to fix than a country’s image. If the country acquires a reputation of a mere transit area, an underdeveloped, inefficient, non productive, hopeless case – it will suffer greatly until this is amended. This – the image – has the gravest possible consequences: repelled investors, reluctant financiers, frightened bankers, disgusted foreign investors. All this amounts to an ex communication of the country.</p>

<p>There are eight known solution to the problems of a country with underdeveloped infrastructure:</p>

<p>It can start by privatizing its infrastructure (commencing with its energy and telecommunications sectors, which are the most attractive to foreign and domestic private investors alike).</p>

<p>Then, it can allow the business sector to operate parts of the national infrastructure. The usual arrangement is that the business sector invests in creating the infrastructure and then collects a fee for operating and maintaining it. The fees collected are large enough to cover both the investment and the maintenance costs. The most famous example are toll roads which are constructed by private sector firms.</p>

<p>Another way is to commercialize the infrastructure (to collect fees for using the telephony network, or highways) and to plough-back the proceeds exclusively into projects of infrastructure. Thus, all the income generated by cars passing in a highway will be dedicated to the construction of additional highways and not be funneled to the general budget.</p>

<p>The fourth method is to adapt the prices of using the infrastructure to the real costs of constructing and of operating it. In most developing countries, consumers pay only a fraction of these real costs. Prices are heavily subsidized and the infrastructure is left to decay and rot away. This, obviously, is a political decision to be taken by the political echelons. In many countries it could create social unrest and have severe political ramifications.</p>

<p>The country could condition investments in multilateral infrastructure projects upon investments in its own, local infrastructure. A multinational firm wishing to invest in a highway (thus reaping considerable cash rewards) – should invest a portion of the future profits in local roads and other forms of infrastructure. A multinational fund which is interested to invest in a telecommunications project connecting three countries, must oblige itself to a “local investment” clause, a “local content purchase” clause or an “offset” (the purchase of local goods against any import of goods connected to the project to the country) clause.</p>

<p>The country must open its markets to domestic and foreign competition by de-regulating itself. It must dismantle trade barriers : tariffs, quotas, restrictions, anti-investment regulations, restrictive standardization and so on. Competition will both lower the costs of the infrastructure and improve its quality, as rival firms will strive to supply more value at less price.</p>

<p>An important condition is that the country does not promote one kind of infrastructure over another. All categories of infrastructure should be simultaneously and similarly stimulated. This will carry favor with the international business community and is bound to alter the image of the country for the better. It will also create a positive feedback loop whereby an improvement in one category of infrastructure will yield improvements in all the others.</p>

  </header>

    <p>A budget is a very important tool when you are trying to meet financial goals. It helps you to see where your money is going and therefore helps you determine where you can cut back. It also gives you something to go by when you get paid rather than piddling your money away. If you are serious about managing your money, a budget is an absolute necessity.</p>

<p>When my husband and I first got married over 14 years ago, we had no idea of how to manage our money. Well, my husband had a little idea, but not me. I worked but I was very frivolous and piddled my money away. We always had a hard time paying our bills because of this. I had nothing to show for my money except make-up, restaurant reviews and other un-necessaries. Then my son came along and changed all of that. I wanted to be a stay-at-home mom.</p>

<p>We also wanted to have more money to travel, save for retirement and college funds, and purchase our own home. This was our motivation for preparing a budget. We knew we had to start managing our money better to be able to do these things and it seemed impossible to have any of it at the time but we had to start somewhere. You should do some thinking as to why you’d like to have more money. Everyone wants to have more money for some reason or another. When you think of reasons, write them down at the top of a piece of paper. This will help you stay on track and give you motivation to stick to your budget.</p>

<p>So anyway, we made a budget and we stuck to it because we had our goals in the back or our mind — first and foremost, to be able to stay home and raise our son. The way we made our budget was to list out everything we HAD to pay to live. We listed rent, power, garbage, phone, gas and food and the amounts we paid on them in a month. Then we listed our credit card bills and the monthly minimum payment amounts. We listed miscellaneous for items like clothing or birthdays that come up. You can list your budget list on the paper that you listed your reasons for wanting to save/manage money. You’ll have to put some thought into some of these items such as food and gasoline. Be sure to be accurate and honest about how much you spend on these items. Look back into your checkbook and add it all up. If you write down less than what you actually spend, it will be harder to cut back.</p>

<p>Once we had made our list of everything we had to pay, we looked at it to see if there was anywhere we could cut back. We saw that we could probably cut back the money we spent on food by using coupons, shopping sales and discount stores, so we lowered the amount we originally budgeted. We saw that we could probably cut back the amount of money we spent on gasoline by making fewer trips to the store, only driving when absolutely necessary, etc. So we lowered that amount also. We vowed to cut back on our power usage — turn off lights when leaving a room, dry clothes on the line, wear sweaters so we can set the thermostat lower, etc. We stuck to these amounts and made it.</p>

<p>At first we didn’t have any money left after paying our necessities but that was okay because we had a roof over our head and I was able to stay home and raise our child. As my husband got raises then eventually started his own yard service, we began to have a little extra money left after our budget was paid. This enabled us to go out once in a while and add a new amount onto our budget called `savings’. Our savings account is where we strive to save for vacations, home improvement, retirement funds, etc. We currently put 20% of our income in there.</p>

<p>Within a few years, we were able to purchase our own house, remodel it a little at a time, make our credit card bills smaller (we eventually hope to be rid of them), buy a nice car and truck and visit Disneyland and Berry Farm. The reason I tell you this is to show what can happen if you do make a budget and stick to it.</p>

    <p>Did you know</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>1 out of 5 kids has been sexually solicited online</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 out of 4 kids has been sent a picture of naked people or people having sex online</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that May 21, 2002 there was the first death of a child linked directly to an Internet Predator?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Parents’ biggest concern about the Internet used to be pornography, but there is definitely a greater fear today.</p>

<p>You have probably taught your child not to talk to strangers, and in many situations, they would remember this. But the Internet is different.</p>

<p>Due to the Internet’s anonymity, strangers are talking to children all the time. They try to gain the child’s trust by having friendly conversation at first, but over time, their true objective of sexually soliciting the child becomes evident. Children and parents alike are unaware of this, yet this is exactly what is going on via the Internet.</p>

<p>What can today’s parent do? Armed with information, there’s quite a bit a parent can do.</p>

<p>Top 5 Internet Safety Tips</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Tell your child to NEVER EVER reveal their name, address, phone number or any other personal information to ANYONE online. Once you give out this information, it is impossible to retract.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communicate regularly (not just once) with your child about WHAT they do online and WHO they talk to online. If you have actually met the friends they are talking to in person, you’ll know it is OK for them to chat with them online.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take computers out of kids’ rooms and put them into public areas such as the family room. Many parents think they are helping with homework by giving the kids a computer, but it also opens certain dangers that you may be unaware of.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Choose your child’s screen name, email address or instant message name wisely – don’t’ reveal ages, sex, hobbies, and CERTAINLY NOT suggestive or sexy names. Predators are more likely to pursue a child with the screen name “foxyteen15″ than “happygirl5″</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use technology to help you protect your child. Monitoring software gives you the ability to review your child’s Internet usage. Even if you don’t look at each and every email or instant message they send, you’ll have a good idea if they are making smart choices online.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The Internet can open many doors and provide useful information for children. An aware and informed parent can help keep children safe.</p>

  </header>

    <p>What are we teaching our children about money? Hopefully something!</p>

<p>I remember when I was growing up, our family did not discuss money. Money was a taboo subject, discussed by the parents and handled by the father.</p>

<p>This is one thing that I wish that was discussed more openly when I was younger. Just a little guidance such as “save 10% of your income” and I would have been fine!</p>

<p>How I wish I could turn back the clocks of time. How I wish I was encouraged to save even 1% of my income. When I look back at the year I started working until this year 2003, I’m not saying I would be a millionaire but I certainly would have been much better off!</p>

<p>Now a grown woman I have acknowledged and accepted the past and moved on to a great future. My bank account is increasing each year, I am currently purchasing rental properties and I am feeling incredible being and doing what I love-a Prosperity Coach!</p>

<p>Now I don’t necessarily encourage parents to show the kids your mortgage statements but I think it is vital that children know that (while the subject of money may be a tad embarrassing for some parents) it IS a necessary part of life. As you start teaching your child, start slow and encourage them to believe in themselves and their future.</p>

<p>Here are some tips to help your child attain prosperity even at a young age:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Buy a piggy bank for your younger children. Allow them to choose whatever color shape or size they desire. Invite them to put their pennies into their piggy bank. Once in a while they may count their pennies and reward themselves if they desire.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When your children have proved themselves to handling their pennies, take them to open their own bank accounts. Encourage them to save at least 10% of what they receive as gifts (I know I used to receive money as gifts when I was young!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your child should be encouraged to donate or contribute another 10% of their savings. Donate to the church, to the homeless, to the depressed, or to a charity of their choice. This would help the youth become more rounded, become more respectful of others regardless of the situation and become more appreciative of their own lives and their own prosperity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many young children think that “money grows on trees”. I applaud this abundance in them (although they may not know that the Universe is in fact limitless) and think we should encourage and nurture this to some extent!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Talk to the kids and let them know that this paper and metal stuff called money is brought about by YOU working. Whether or not you work or you have inherited a large fortune, don’t encourage laziness in your child. They need to be able to work for free sometimes to learn the value of hard work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Money101 is not taught in schools. Where your child’s future is heading depends on what you want your child to know. Prepare your child for their future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When your child is old enough encourage your child to purchase a journal or a diary where they can record their dreams and desires. This allows them to dream big and look forward to their lives ahead-filled with prosperity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they can manage and understand the budgeting process I’m all for it. When grandma gives them money for their birthday, after they have put aside 10% each for savings and for donation to a charity, allow them to budget for the remainder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m sure there are loads of chores around the house, washing the dishes, cleaning the rooms, etc. Give your children an allowance but let them work for it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the kids participate in the family’s money decisions. They may not understand everything but their minds will open up to the energy that money has and will prepare them for their lives ahead.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The kids are our future. I know it may sound a little clinch but the fact is they are. If you truly interested in your child’s future prepare them and trust that the process will work and they will be A-okay! I guarantee it!</p>

  </header>

    <p>Does this sound familiar?</p>

<p>You stumble out of bed in the morning, feel your way to the kitchen, and desperately reach for the coffee pot, hoping that the caffeine will jolt you awake. But soon you find yourself drifting off.</p>

<p>In today’s fast world, many, if not most people are just getting too little sleep and it is becoming a growing concern.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that one fourth to one half of all Americans get too little sleep. Sleep deprivation can cause many serious side effects, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity.</p>

<p>It can also reduce your body’s ability to respond to sudden circumstances by slowing your reaction time when you may need it the most. This can be especially dangerous if you are driving a car or working machinery, causing a serious injury or even death.</p>

<p>According to the National Institutes of Health, sleep disorders and sleep deprivation are costing Americans about $16 billion a year in health care. In addition, it is costing American businesses around $50 billion a year in lost man hours and work related injuries.</p>

<p>You probably already know that the average adult is recommended to get at least eight hours of sleep each night, but with today’s hectic schedules, most people are getting far less than they need.</p>

<p>So what is the answer for this growing problem? The first thing many people do is to try an over the counter sleeping pill. But many sleep remedies are ineffective and can create more health problems than they cure.</p>

<p>Even if they prove to be effective, they certainly are not the long term solution.</p>

<p>The simplest answer would be to go to bed earlier, but for many people, even that would not solve the problem. Our minds are racing a mile a minute reviewing today’s events, as well as planning for tomorrow.</p>

<p>The problem, in most cases, is that your body has been deprived of sleep for so long that it has been trained to accept that as normal. But for your body to perform, as it should, the proper amount of sleep is essential. It must be retrained for this.</p>

<p>The first step is to see your doctor to make sure that there is not a more serious problem.</p>

<p>If you are otherwise in good health, your doctor can recommend specific strategies and solutions to help you get the sleep you need.</p>

<p>Even if you do not think that you have a sleep disorder, consider how many hours of sleep you are getting each night. If you are getting less than seven hours, then you need to make some changes, for it will catch up to eventually at the most inopportune time.</p>

  </header>

    <p>What if you are doing your life perfectly? What if the things that you think are failings on your part are not really failings at all? Has it ever occurred to you that as a child you perfectly absorbed information from your environment, learning wholeheartedly when your brain was not yet able to discern truth from fiction nor to apply reason and thought?</p>

<p>Our friends Amy and Andy have a beautiful little boy, Alex. We were privileged to be at the hospital when he was born and have watched him on his journey from infancy to early childhood.</p>

<p>At the ripe old age of 22 months, you could see that Alex had learned many things, demonstrating that he clearly knew the difference between hard and soft. When Alex wanted to express his displeasure at not getting his way (like being asked to eat the Cheerios from a small baggie rather than from the big box he wanted to hold) he would throw himself on the floor in an impressive display of histrionics. The velocity of Alex’s descent to the floor depended on which room of the house he was in during his meltdown. In the family room, he did a full-fledged flop since the floor has thick carpeting. But Alex was more cautious on the wood floors and avoided landing on stone if he could help it. One time, he got upset while he was on the brick walkway leading to the front door. He prepared himself for a full tilt fit but managed to stop the action before hitting brick. He actually picked himself up and walked the few feet to the cushy welcome mat before “spontaneously” throwing himself down to cry.</p>

<p>Yes, Alex had learned well and his little boy mind had collected all sorts of useful information, causing him to feel passionately about many things. When Alex was 15 months old he discovered circles. For some time, Alex was like an investigative reporter, on the hunt for anything round that he could point out with glee to his parents, and to anyone who would listen. “‘ircle!” Alex would shout. It seems that while his brain was able to identify the shape, his mouth could not yet form the “S” sound at the beginning of the word. So instead of being surrounded by circular shapes, Alex’s world was inhabited by “‘ircles.”</p>

<p>Alex could find ‘ircles anywhere – the balloon motif around the ceiling at the doctor’s office, a clock face, a ball. The MasterCardTM logo once sent Alex into a frenzy when he realized it had two overlapping ‘ircles. It often surprised his parents that round shapes, even if they were simply a part of the background environment, could be spotlighted by Alex’s nimble mind. Amy and Andy found the passion their son had for ‘ircles endearing. They did however, from time-to-time, feel concerned that Alex couldn’t pronounce the word correctly. They could only hope that sooner or later Alex would be able to fix his earlier mistake in pronunciation when his ability to speak caught up with his powers of observation.</p>

<p>One day, while casually leaning on the door-frame watching his son play, Andy had a stunning revelation. Alex was on all fours, rolling a big yellow school bus back and forth, one of his favorite toys. On the side of the bus were four shapes: a triangle, a square, a heart and a circle. Plopping on his behind, Alex pushed the triangle and when the button was depressed, the electronic voice exclaimed, “Triangle!” When Alex hit the square, the voice called out, “Square!” and then he pushed the big round button</p>

<p>All of us have learned how to behave and relate from things we put together as youngsters or by things we absorbed from our environment. But that was before we had the benefit of discerning whether or not we were getting complete or accurate information.</p>

<p>As you go through life, it’s very easy to blame one’s parents or teachers or environment and say they were bad role models or deficient in some way. But stop and think. Those people you may seek to blame also learned and absorbed from their environments without their young minds being able to discern truth from fiction or apply reason and thought.</p>

<p>Just the way Andy discovered the defective audio in the toy while watching his son, you can also discover how you function. Casually lean on the door-frame of your life and observe how you operate without judging what you discover. You will be instantaneously empowered to include small details that were omitted. If you can treat yourself with humor, love and respect, much like you would a young child who is learning from his or her environment, you will reclaim your wholehearted nature and passion for living. When you allow yourself to rediscover the art of self-observation without self-reproach, it will have a profound impact on your well-being.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2014/07/13/tackle-your-babys-early-waking/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Tackle your baby&#8217;s early waking</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Most babies are naturally early risers. Being up before the milkman is all part and parcel of being a parent of a young child, and to a large extent it is something that you have to accept and go along with.</p>

<p>In my experience, early waking problems are notoriously difficult to tackle, as when your baby has had a long block of sleep [even if it is not technically enough]he will find it very difficult to re settle. This is especially true in the 1 -2 year age group, when babies are only too aware of the delights of the coming day.</p>

<p>Putting your baby to bed later in the evening rarely makes any difference to the time that he wakes in the morning. This is because he is often “programmed” by both internal and external wake up triggers.</p>

<p>Parents vary in the opinions about what constitutes an acceptable getting up time for their baby, but generally, provided he wakes up happy – between 6am and 8am can be considered a normal wake up time for a baby. So when might early waking be considered a problem?</p>

<p>1.If your baby wakes before 6am and is crying and still looking tired.</p>

<p>2.If your baby has a ritual of a dawn waking and crying, followed by a milk feed or transfer to your bed – and then back to sleep.</p>

<p>3.If your baby is tired and grumpy on waking and then takes an early, lengthy daytime nap.</p>

<p>If any of the above factors sound familiar to you, then it is well worth considering some gentle sleep training in the early mornings to extend your baby’s sleep.</p>

<p>First of all, you need to take an honest look at your baby’s over all sleep ability. If early waking is part of a picture of generally poor settling and night waking, you need to address what happens at the beginning of the night and during the night first of all. You will get no where with morning sleep training if you do not have good bedtime settling practices.</p>

<p>If your baby’s early waking is part of his generally poor sleeping skills, you should concentrate on teaching her to fall asleep independently at the start of the night and on removing any incentives for night time waking.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<p>-Giving an unnecessary night feed</p>

<p>-Moving your baby into bed with you during the night</p>

<p>-Allowing her to play or watch a DVD during the night</p>

<p>You should then treat the early waking just as if it were a night waking; offering the same consistent response as you did at settling and night waking times. If you approach it in this way, you have a great chance of successfully stopping the early waking.</p>

<p>If you have sorted out any problems earlier in the night and your child is still waking early, crying, rubbing her eyes and looking very tired, it is clear that she needs to sleep on for longer and needs your help to do so. It is not a good idea to leave her alone for a long period to cry, before going in to her, as you will teach her that in order for the day to begin she has to cry for you. This is not good start to the day for either her or you. It is better to go to her before she becomes upset, and praise her for being in her cot.</p>

<p>You need to tell her or indicate to her that it is still sleep time and then either remain beside her or keep popping in and out to her until you reach an acceptable getting up time. When you reach this time, you should open her curtains [even if it is still dark outside] before getting her out of her cot, just to give her a visual prompt/signifier that it is now getting up time. She will soon come to realise that when the curtains are closed it means that it is sleep time. If at the beginning of the night, you incorporate closing her curtains before she goes into her cot as a part of her settling routine, you will further reinforce this message. These visual time clues and routines are very important for babies, who obviously are not yet able to tell the time.</p>

<p>For the over 2 years old, you can use a bunny training clock which at a time pre set by you, will “wake up” and let your child know that it is time to get up. [Just make sure that the clock is out of reach, as many clever toddlers have been known to wake bunny up all by themselves at 2am!]</p>

<p>When tackling your baby’s early waking, the first thing to aim for is that she simply stays in her bed or cot when she wakes up. Once she is able to do this, she will have the opportunity to go back to sleep.</p>

<p>If your child really struggles to go back to sleep, it is best to gradually extend the period that you expect her to lie in her cot or bed.</p>

<p>If you are using a sleep training clock or just simply opening the curtains as a daytime signifier you should:</p>

<p>For the first morning, use the “getting up” prompt at the time that your child normally wakes up at first. This is so that she gets the hang of what is going on has a pleasant experience of the day time trigger. Setting it too late in the very early days will mean that your child may lose heart, laying in her bed watching for the day time signal.</p>

<p>It is better to start at an achievable time and then move it forward by 5 minutes every morning until you reach an acceptable getting up time. There is no doubt that early waking is one of the most tricky childhood sleep problems to overcome, but with patience, confidence and resolve – you will get there in the end.</p>
