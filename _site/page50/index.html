  </header>

    <p>Success is in the blood. There are men whom fate can never keep down they march forward in a jaunty manner, and take by divine right the best of everything that the earth affords. But their success is not attained by means of the Samuel Smiles-Connecticut policy. They do not lie in wait, nor scheme, nor fawn, nor seek to adapt their sails to catch the breeze of popular favor. Still, they are ever alert and alive to any good that may come their way, and when it comes they simply appropriate it, and tarrying not, move steadily on.</p>

<p>Good health! Whenever you go out of doors, draw the chin in, carry the crown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost; drink in the sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into every hand-clasp.</p>

<p>Do not fear being misunderstood; and never waste a moment thinking about your enemies. Try to fix firmly in your own mind what you would like to do, and then without violence of direction you will move straight to the goal.</p>

<p>Fear is the rock on which we split, and hate the shoal on which many a barque is stranded. When we become fearful, the judgment is as unreliable as the compass of a ship whose hold is full of iron ore; when we hate, we have unshipped the rudder; and if ever we stop to meditate on what the gossips say, we have allowed a hawser to foul the screw.</p>

<p>Keep your mind on the great and splendid thing you would like to do; and then, as the days go gliding by, you will find yourself unconsciously seizing the opportunities that are required for the fulfillment of your desire, just as the coral insect takes from the running tide the elements that it needs. Picture in your mind the able, earnest, useful person you desire to be, and the thought that you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual you so admire.</p>

<p>Thought is supreme, and to think is often better than to do.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2010/08/22/a-trading-plan/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">A trading plan</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>A trading plan is having a definite market or field to target. This actually gets even more specific with particular stocks chosen for how they will help a trader achieve a goal. A good trader chooses a field that he’s interested in or has easy access to information about. This is because the stock market is a fluid thing and the only way to make sure you don’t get any nasty surprises is to always have your ear to the ground for any developments or trends that may affect the price of company stocks. Being interested in a field also translates well into this and most traders have a preferred field or commodity that they focus on. Information is money in the field of stocks and when you’re interested, you’re more attentive to something.</p>

<p>Finally, entry and exit strategies into a market are formulated to reflect a trader’s personality. A daring trader can wish to make his margins of acceptable higher or a more conservative trader would lower his negative sell price a bit higher, so as to avoid a larger loss. All of this is mostly done to assist a trader to accept a trading plan’s instructions for them. Going against personal instinct is a hard thing, that’s why traders tailor-make their strategies to match their temperament. Any disagreement between a trader’s “feelings” and the trading strategy selected can cause a moment of indecision. With the lightning speed of the rise and fall of stocks on the market, that moment may be the difference between thousand dollars of profit or a thousand dollars of loss. \par</p>

<p>There you go, a simple guide to how trading plans work and how to make one. If you’re interested into going into the stock market, you better try your best to make a good one and to follow it well. A good plan always succeeds after all.</p>
