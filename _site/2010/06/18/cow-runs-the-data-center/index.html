    <p>It may sound a cow boy joke, but one has to trust and believe. Yes, the cows can run the data center of leading IT giants like Google and Microsoft. The recent study by engineers from Hewlett and Packard revealed that, the fuel from the cattle waste can easily run the data-centers in a greener and most profitable way.</p>

<p>In their research paper, they have come out with the findings that the waste per day from a cow can run a 100 watts light-bulb. As such, as many as 10000 cows can produce the waste that is more than sufficient to cater to the energy need of the data center of a bank.</p>

<p>In the USA it is reported that the IT companies are in search of suitable farm lands in the rural areas adjoining the cattle farms to exploit this energy source. If it is stabilized, the bio fuel from the farm and cattle waste can be put in to best use to meet out the energy needs of the IT companies and taking care of the environmental protection.</p>

<p>It is also suggested that such corporate houses can go in for the diversification in the farming sector to enhance the opportunity to use the farm waste for their energy needs.</p>
