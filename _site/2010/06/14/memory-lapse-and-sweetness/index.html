    <p>Taste of sweet is found to bring the bitterness in many ways in our life as found by various research. The awareness on the ill effect of sugar on the human health is almost discussed every minute around the globe. Right from the impact on the kidney and ultimate multi organ failure, the research is going on to study the adverse impact of increased level of sugar in the blood.</p>

<p>Recent study by experts from Flinders University, has come out with yet another shocking revelation on the impact of abnormal sugar level in the body. The study cautions that, the inclination towards more and more chocolate and ice cream with a lot of sweetness lead to affect the brain.</p>

<p>Consuming foodstuff with more sweetness can lead to the consequences ranging from the simple memory lapse to car crashes according to the researchers the memory lapse is found to increase with the increasing level of sweet as tested in the laboratory. Hence, it is up to us to avoid the sweet beyond a level and ensure better memory.</p>
