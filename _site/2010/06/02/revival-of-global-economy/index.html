    <p>I used to wonder whether the economic recession is due for repetition by observing the various events around the globe and especially in Europe. The nations like Greece and Spain are in the process of introducing various austerity measures. But the million dollar question is whether they are going to bail out the ailing economy and drive the growth.</p>

<p>As I read in an article, the observation by the leading economist Mr. Stiglitz discloses a different picture. According to his judgement, the present approach by Greece and Spain is not going to yield the desired result. Alternatively, they are bounds to confound the problem by reducing the tax collection and public spending. When they said approach was followed in Brazil and Argentina, the result was not positive to tackle the issue. Argentina could not come out of the problem completely while Brazil was able to manage the debt due to the over liquidity.</p>

<p>Every country wants to get rid of the deficit by resorting to austerity measures that are not going to fuel the economic growth. It is advisable to go in for the debt restructuring by the nations and even debt write-off if needed to maintain the growth momentum. Like Brazil, the nation can grow once the market is rationalized. However, the interest rate must be under control and preferably kept at low level to spur the growth to tackle all the issues in the long-term perspective.</p>
