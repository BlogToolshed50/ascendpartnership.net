    <p>Many people believe that it’s more difficult to get cheap holidays for families, but if you research, you can find some great money-saving deals.</p>

<p>Family holidays are inevitably expensive because of the number of people travelling. In addition, most families are bound by school holidays, which means that they have to travel during the year’s peak seasons – Christmas, Easter and the summer. Try these tips to help keep costs down.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Travel out of season</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have children that are below school age, then travelling outside the school holidays is a good way to keep costs down. Flying just a week before or after the main holiday periods can make a big difference to the price. For short breaks, try mid-week instead of weekend.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Try different accommodation</li>
</ol>

<p>Instead of hotels, look into renting a self-catering apartment or villa. These are usually much cheaper than hotel accommodation and although you have to buy your own food, you can still make good savings, and you get the additional benefit of flexibility – eat and come and go as you choose – which is ideal for a family holiday.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Book early</li>
</ol>

<p>If you like to return to the same place each year, then think about booking early. The earlier you book, the cheaper it can be and you can always book your accommodation and then wait for cheap flights to be released later on in the year. Register with online sites to get notification of good deals so that you can make savings as soon as possible.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Special family deals</li>
</ol>

<p>Look out for package holidays that offer free flights or accommodation for children. Check out the small print to make sure that you really are getting a deal, but these are often great ways of ensuring that you don’t have to spend a fortune on your family holiday.</p>

<p>By starting early and taking the time to look at special offers and family deals, you can take your family on a great holiday for a great price.</p>
