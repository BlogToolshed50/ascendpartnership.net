    <p>“Money Growing on Trees” sounds little incredible, but one has to believe it to the core if the matter I read in one of the newspaper is trusted and analysed for a while. The conservation of the rain forest trees is assuring the money needed for the development in the African countries like Gabon, Ghana Kenya and Liberia.</p>

<p>You will be astonished to know that Africa had lost as much as 3.4 million hectares of forest lands and the precious trees on it in the last 10 years a per the recent report of UN Food and Agricultural Organization. One can easily visualize the amount of carbon that is released to the atmosphere due to the falling of trees in such a vast area. It is estimated that one hectare of such rain forest trees is believed to store between 100 to 300 tonnes of carbon.</p>

<p>A country like Liberia can easily sell the carbon unit under the Clean development Mechanism to the developed countries where the emission of carbon is higher the limit prescribed by the KYOTA protocol. They can buy the carbon credit from these African countries if they are able to maintain the rain forest trees for the international expectation and use the sum for their development projects. Every country should venture to explore the possibility of such conservation to mint money from the tree.</p>
