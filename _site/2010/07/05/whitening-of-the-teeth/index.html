    <p>When your teeth becomes yellowish, you become more concerned since you feel that you are not  presentable when you smile. It is a common feeling that each one of us  have in this modern world of increased socialization. I read an article recently that explains the ways and means of maintaining your teeth white with outgoing to the clinic.</p>

<p>The discoloration of the teeth is due to non cleaning of the teeth after food and taking coffee and tea. The stains develop if it is not cleaned regularly. The easiest method is to go in for the tooth paste that are added with the solution for whitening the teeth. Since we brush every day, the continued usage of such type of tooth pastes will remove the stains over a period of time.</p>

<p>Also, teeth whitening strips are also available in the market and the same can be put on the teeth during the nighttime so that, it can remove the stain easily. They contain the solution that is active against the discoloration. In fact, the strips can be used even during the daytime as other cannot identify the same.</p>

<p>The teeth whitening trays are also now in use and the same is also available in the market for use at home. Instead of spending heavy amounts for removing the stains by going to the Doctor, we can easily get rid of the same staying at home by adopting to the means described in the foregoing lines.</p>

<p>As a common practice it is better that we constantly follow the regular brushing of our teeth and cleaning after taking food and beverages. Our dependence on the chemical solutions to remove the stain must be reduced to have healthy and white teeth.</p>
