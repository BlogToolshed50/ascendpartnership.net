    <p>Guest post written by Al Hartford</p>

<p>When I saw the commercials for Avatar, I couldn’t wait for it to come on my favorite channel HBO. In 2009, Avatar took us to a world of spectacular imagination, when a recalcitrant hero started off on an epic adventure. Fighting to save this world he has just begun to call home, Jake must battle not only epic and dangerous creatures, but his own comrades in order to save his new home, the only place he has felt comfortable since he took on the Avatar suit.</p>

<p>Oscar award-winning director of the epic film Titanic, James Cameron first thought up the plot for this movie 15 years ago. Unable to do it then, he has finally seen his dream of Avatar come true.</p>

<p>Now we are brought into a world of strange creatures, epic heros, and beauty beyond imagining. With Sam Worthington as Jake the Avatar, he gets quite lost in the world of the Na’vi, with just Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) as his guide through the Na’vi’s spectacular, awesomely gorgeous world.</p>

<p>This movie blew me away. Avatar brought me into a beautiful, danger-filled world, filling me with love and admiration for its inhabitants. The world of the Na’vi is simply gorgeous, with strange creatures and beauty at every turn. I could not get enough of this world, just staring transfixed at every new beauteous creature, every gorgeous piece of landscape that popped up. This movie was one of my favorites simply for the beautiful landscape, much less the plot and characters.</p>

<p>I watch movies on HBO on satellite t.v. all the time. Avatar had me glued to the screen from the first moment, and I could not look away. Avatar has become one of my all-time favorite movies from www.TVByDirect.com, where I purchased by Satellite tv service.</p>

<p>Besides movies, I like series as well. I love True Blood, the action is really cool, way better than those cheesy vampire movies out now. I also can’t wait for Steve Buscemi’s new series too.</p>
