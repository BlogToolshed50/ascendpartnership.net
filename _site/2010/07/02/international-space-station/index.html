    <p>The research activity in the space is attempted relentlessly by many leading nations for the scientific exploration of the space. This attempt is aimed at finding out the presence of life in various planets and also to study the various wealth hidden ion the surface of the earth. Most of the research at present are concentrated to improve the communication facilities via satellites.</p>

<p>The International Space Station also an important step towards this objective where in few nations joined together to develop the research facility. The research facility is assembled in the low earth orbit. The work for the International Space Station began by 1998 and the station is expected to function until 2015 and can be operative even up to 2020 as predicted. In fact, the ISS is said to be by far the largest artificial satellite, which serves as the research laboratory.</p>

<p>ISS has a microgravity environment where in the crews are able to conduct experiments in on various subjects like biology, physics astronomy human biology and a lot on meteorology. It is a matter of pride for the human kind that the programmer in ISS is approaching the record 10 years of operation by 23rd Oct2010. Though the scientific advancement creates certain disasters also, it is a must that the scientific world aims at using such facilities to help the humans for the progress in the right path.</p>
