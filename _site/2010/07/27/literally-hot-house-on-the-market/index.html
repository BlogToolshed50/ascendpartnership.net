<p>OK, I guess there’s really no good time for the air conditioning unit to break – except maybe during a blizzard – but this was an exceptionally bad time because our house is currently on the market. My job is taking me across the state and although commuting every day sounded like a good option, it just wasn’t a realistic or financially sound idea.</p>

<p>Our house was immaculate once the real estate agent staked the FOR SALE sign down in our yard. But then a week and a half later, right in the middle of June, our cooling unit stopped working. We called up the hvac pros sears because some former clients of hers had a good experience with them when they were in the same situation.</p>

<p>We called them up immediately and got a decent estimate that we thought would be worth it considering we were trying to sell our house as soon as possible. The new unit was installed really quickly and the next week our house was sold. I was sad to leave our home, but our house in my new location is a little larger and has a bigger yard!</p>
