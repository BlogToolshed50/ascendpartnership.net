    <p>Guest post from: Constance Rodgers</p>

<p>My favorite awards show would have to be the Oscars. Every year I make it a point to watch this particular awards show. I get so excited as the date nears. I always make sure that I’m not disturbed while I am watching them by turning off my phone. I’m always so excited as I check my directv channel lineup around San Diego and watch the pre-show before the main show begins.</p>

<p>I’m not exactly sure which part is my most favorite, but I would probably have to say that the dresses the Actresses wear are probably one of my most favorite things. Each year I play a game with myself and try to figure out which ones will be on the best and worst dress lists the following day. I’m the type that goes for classic beauty. I don’t like when they dress really “out there”. I love the long flowing gowns or the ones that resemble old fashion designs.</p>

<p>I’m also a big fan of the hair. I love to see how each actress is going to wear their hair. I like when they wear it down and curly. I’m not really crazy about up-do’s. Some actresses really know how to put their elegant looks together. It’s so important not to over do the look. Some actresses wear loud dresses and loud hairstyles. You can’t have both.</p>
