    <p>Have you ever heard the expression, “Do not count your chickens before they hatch?” Maybe an older, I suggest that you first do a Must Have, Why, How analysis.</p>

<p>First, write down a list of must haves; bigger home, luxury trips, new cars, work from home, etc. Then decide why these must haves are important to you and prioritize them. Lastly, write down how you are going to get the must haves.</p>

<p>Also, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<p>Why do I not have what I want now?</p>

<p>What are the tools and resources do I need?</p>

<p>What past experiences are in the way?</p>

<p>Who can I talk to that has already succeeded?</p>

<p>How am I paying for this?</p>

<p>What are the tradeoffs?</p>

<p>What am I going to give up?</p>

<p>From this analysis, start writing down you goals. Remember, without a start, there cannot be an ending. Denis Watley stated “The reason most people never reach their goals is that they do not define them, or ever seriously consider them as believable or achievable. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way, and who will be sharing the adventure with them.”</p>

<p>Once finished writing your goals, next you need to start visualizing your dreams. Henry David Thoreau once said “If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.” You need image yourself accomplishing your goals and obtaining your treasures. Will yourself into succeeding. Never think that you cannot reach your desired results. Talk about the desires as if you have already obtained it. A good practice is to read your goals daily. If you are having a bad day, read them over and over.</p>
