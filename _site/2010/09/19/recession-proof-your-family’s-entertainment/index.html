    <p>Recession does not mean boredom for your family. You do not have to slump down at home trying to sleep the recession away when you can still have fun without having to spend too much. Here are some ways to keep your family entertained without putting a big dent to your budget.</p>

<p>Grow a Green Thumb – Low Cost Way to Have Fun and Have Food</p>

<p>Gardening is one of the most productive and yet less-costly ways to entertain oneself. If you have the kids helping, you can double the fun. Just as long as you do not use high-maintenance, which are also usually expensive plants, you can have a ball growing vegetables and fruits that you can also use to make your own meals. This means more savings for your family!</p>

<p>Watch your Local Sports Team – Inexpensive Way to Support your Local Team</p>

<p>Kids enjoy watching sports. Support your local sports team by adding yourself and your kid as part of its seated cheering squad.</p>

<p>Go to community events – Low Cost Activity to Enjoy your Neighborhood’s Events</p>

<p>Your local local colleges, city bulletin boards, newspaper listings, and libraries usually post special entertainment events that you can attend for free.</p>

<p>Host a Garage Sale – Fun and Inexpensive Way to Earn Extra Income</p>

<p>It’s high time to get rid of your old bags that only gather dust in your closet. And what better way to get rid of it than to sell it in a garage sale. A garage sale is not just a way to earn you extra money, it can be highly entertaining, too. Getting the whole family to participate, from gathering the items, pricing and selling them can be a whole bunch of fun.</p>
