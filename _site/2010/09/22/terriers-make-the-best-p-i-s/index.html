<p>Thank god for the San Diego P.I’s is getting great reviews from critics and should be another must see show for the network.</p>

<p>The show stars Donal Logue and Michael Raymond-James as unlicensed private investigators Hank Dolworth and Britt Pollack. Dolworth (Logue) is an ex-cop who reluctantly joins the private eye game with his buddy Pollack (Raymond-James). The show is supposed to be an homage to classic private eye shows of the past. From the network’s description, Hank and Britt are far from glamorous and even when they come out on top, they’re going to look ugly doing it (not to be taken literally). There’s something about flawed, multi-layered characters that attracts us – especially when they are underdogs (rooting for underdogs seems to be a dominant gene among homo sapiens).</p>

<p>I’ve been a fan of Logue’s since he played Eddie on ‘Felicity’. He was born to play misfit characters and this is right up his alley. His ability to play the same types of characters in different ways is astounding. He’ll go from being a romantic misfit on ‘Felicity’, to a fatherly misfit on ‘Grounded for Life’, make a left and become misfit doctor on ‘ER’, etc.,. I literally cannot wait to see him play a gritty misfit on ‘Terriers’.</p>
