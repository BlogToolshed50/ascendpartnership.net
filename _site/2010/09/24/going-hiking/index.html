<p>Hiking is a great pastime for many outdoors families. Strapping on the backpack and heading out into the trails and woods is a great way for a family to spend a day together getting exercise and fresh air. It’s also important to make sure you check your house before you leave, setting the home security alarm and making sure the electronics are shut off. I’m not worried about burglars because in San Jose ADT stickers seem to be a good deterant as well.</p>

<p>Going hiking is a lot of fun. While some pursue difficult trails and hills, others prefer to take it easy, walking the marked trails and just enjoying nature. Picking up different items in nature can be a lot of fun as well as an educational experience for children and adults alike.</p>

<p>Many families like to make a day of hiking with bird watching, animal watching, and sightseeing in the wilderness. For many, there are marked, paved trails to follow and much to see while walking. Some families like to incorporate hiking with camping and fishing. Either way, when going hiking you have to be prepared.</p>

<p>Take plenty of water to keep everyone hydrated. Be prepared for accidents with a well stocked first aid kit and a signaling device. Everyone can have a great time hiking while still being prepared for emergencies. Hiking is a perfect way to enjoy a day outside with family and friends, getting some fresh air and exercise.</p>
