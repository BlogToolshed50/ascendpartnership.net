    <p>When it comes to an event, you need to make sure that you make it educational, entertaining, and memorable. This is extremely important when you have to place a charity event in the making. So what makes an event all these things? Well you should look at each of them separately. What can you do to make an even educational? What can you do to make it entertaining? What will make this a memorable event that no one will be able to forget?</p>

<p>First, look at the educational aspect. What is the charity or event for? You need to state your purpose or goal everywhere. You can do this in several ways. Once way that you can be educational is by placing stands or show pieces around the event like an art show. Place random facts on the walls or on display so that you can get your guests thinking. You can put on a movie or documentary about the charity and show the people first hand what is really going on and why they should help. You could also do a speech with the help of visual aids to help support your charity. All of these are great ideas when it comes to making something educational, but what about entertaining.</p>

<p>Well if you want just entertainment you can have a band or singer perform at the event. However, that can be expensive. If you are having a charity, you should make sure that you mix entertainment with educational. Basically, you should try to find ways like through plays and other art forms to entertain and to educate. You never know how creative you can get until you try to mix education and entertainment. When you try to mix them you will find that your creativity will pour out ideas and you’ll have success in doing so. You need to make sure that the entertainment is clean and fun, especially for charity events.</p>
