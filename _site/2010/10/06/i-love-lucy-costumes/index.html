<p>I started watching the show I Love Lucy when I was a little girl so I wasn’t really surprised when my daughter started to love the show too because I still watch it all the time when it comes on TV, which is a couple of times a day. So when I asked her what she wanted to dress up as for Halloween, she told me that she wanted to be Lucy.</p>

<p>I think the idea is so cute, I wish I had thought of dressing up as Lucy back when I was a little girl, that I started looking for stuff for her to wear right away. During my search for a red wig for her to wear, I saw some deals on satellite internet service and decided to click here and switch over to a new provider.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, most Lucy style hair wigs are for adults, not kids. So I bought an adult Lucy wig trimming it down so that it will fit on my daughter’s head. She talked one of the little neighbor boys that she pals aroudn with to dress up as Ricky so I’m going to find him a bongo set to carry around too.</p>
