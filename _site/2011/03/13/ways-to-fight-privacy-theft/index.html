    <p>Identity theft is fast rising up on the list of crimes being committed in the US. Last year’s identity theft statistics state that almost 9.5 million Americans became victims of privacy theft, collectively suffering a loss of almost five billion dollars. Anybody can become a victim of privacy theft and in a day and age where information is already easily available, it is extremely important that you take all kinds of precautions to prevent identity theft.</p>

<p>Identity theft prevention is extremely important if you do not want to be defrauded and you should take special care never to disclose your bank account numbers, credit card numbers and social security number to anybody apart from authorized people. Giving such information over the phone to different callers is a complete no no and it is advised that you unsubscribe from unsolicited promotional calls. Giving away pin numbers is a big mistake and so is letting people stand behind while you operate your ATM or credit card.</p>
