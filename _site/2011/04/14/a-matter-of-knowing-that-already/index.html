    <p>By opening up your minds to new possibilities, you may find that you are being led by that glorious, higher self within us to explore possibilities that have the potential to bring us peace, joy, wealth, success — all good things.</p>

<p>If someone tells you that you shouldn’t do something because it doesn’t work, what that person is really saying is that it doesn’t work for him. Listen to your heart, gather all the information and let the Universe show you how to make it work.</p>

<p>Listens a lot more that reflects and thinks about what you hears, sees or reads. You are willing to listen to points of view that are totally different from your own without getting defensive as he used to. As a result, he has become more tolerant, more compassionate and, in many ways, more successful. He has grown into a fantastic young man who, I am sure, will bring much credit to all that you chooses to do.</p>

<p>Let us not be like the person in the little ditty who says:</p>

<p>“In matters controversial, my perception’s really fine. I always see both points of view — the one that’s wrong and mine.”</p>

<p>Let us, instead, listen to all that comes to our notice and after reflecting on it, exhibit the qualities of tolerance, peace, understanding and compassion. And as Commander Spock would say, “Live long and prosper.”</p>
