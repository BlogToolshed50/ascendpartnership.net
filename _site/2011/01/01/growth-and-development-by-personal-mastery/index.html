    <p>Personal mastery is not something you can accomplish overnight. It is not just going beyond what you can do with your skills and talents. Personal mastery is how you understand and direct your life. For an organization to succeed, each person member of the organization has to be part of the organization purpose and make it their own personal purpose.</p>

<p>When each member of the organization adapts the organization purpose as their purpose, personal and organization growth increases. Imagine the power of an organization whose member believe and are committed to one idea? This is the deepest commitment an organization could ever have.</p>

<p>Personal mastery also helps organization members to step out of the box or their comfort zones. Some organization leaders are not comfortable would this idea sometimes, especially if the activities in the comfort zone are those that have produced success. But stepping out of the comfort zone strips people of the self-imposed limitations. Personal mastery is about expressing your talents and yourself in creative manner.</p>

<p>Growth and development are the concepts encouraged by personal mastery. When organization members are working to attain personal mastery, their personal vision clears and starts getting fulfilled. There are changes that can happen when organization members work for personal mastery like easy resolution even in hard issues and cases, teams and groups work easily even if they do not belong in the same department and accomplishments is starting to be common in the organization.</p>

<p>An organization can help their members to attain personal mastery, there are trainings, consultancy and coaching which can be provided to individuals, teams and even to the whole organization. Training and consultations could include self-leadership, stress- management, well being, emotional and social intelligence and other related disciplines.</p>

<p>Dealing with these different aspects would surely improve the organization performance. Organizations should capitalize on their most important asset, their people. Organization members who have attained personal mastery would understand the organization’s strategy, how their own actions contribute to their colleague’s and superiors performance, and how their tasks in part of the whole performance.</p>
