    <p>Bird lovers and bird watchers often strive to entice birds to their yards, especially during the harsh winter months when food and proper shelter may be hard to find. Start by outfitting your yard with a bird bath, bird houses, and bird feeders. Depending on your location in the world and the types of birds that are native to your area, you should work to provide the correct food and houses for those species. Also, you may want to consider investing in a heated bird bath, especially if you live in cold climates where winter’s wrath can freeze the water in the bath, preventing your feathered friends from enjoying the water. Also, consider planting specific flowers and plants in your yard that will draw birds to your home. In addition to bringing beauty to your yard, these bird friendly plants will invite your flying pals to your home.</p>

<p>However you decide to begin bird watching, do so immediately! Many individuals who experience stress-filled lives find that bird watching is the perfect activity to unwind and release the stresses and pressures of their work or home life.</p>
