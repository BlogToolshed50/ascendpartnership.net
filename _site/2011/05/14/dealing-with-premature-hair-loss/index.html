    <p>The fact you are reading this probably indicates you have concerns about the rate of your hair loss. Baldness may sometimes be a source of amusement to those with a full head of hair, but premature hair loss at any age can be the cause of intense concern to those affected.</p>

<p>But you can do something about this! By following the guidelines suggested in this article you will place yourself in a position to identify a hair loss treatment that not only works but also fits in with your lifestyle and preferences.</p>

<p>To achieve this you must truthfully answer four simple questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the true cause of your hair loss?</li>
</ol>

<p>Most instances of hair loss in men, for example, can be attributed to androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness) but you must be certain as this will influence your choice of hair loss treatment. To be completely certain you should consult with your physician.</p>

<ol>
  <li>How far has your hair loss progressed?</li>
</ol>

<p>It is crucial to realize that the sooner you start treating hair loss, the greater your chances of success. You need to identify the pattern of hair loss as this will help establish both the cause and most effective treatment option.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What hair loss treatment options are you prepared to consider?</li>
</ol>

<p>Your answer to this question will depend on a number of factors including the type and extent of hair loss, what treatments have been tried previously, your personal preferences with regard to using medications or natural remedies and the amount you are prepared to spend.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do you have sufficient patience and determination to succeed?</li>
</ol>

<p>There really are no miracle cures for premature hair loss. Equally, there are treatments that can halt and even reverse this condition, but none of them will work overnight. Treatments take time to work and there is no such thing as a remedy that suits everyone.</p>

<p>When you have given proper consideration to these questions you will find yourself in a better position to choose the hair loss treatment that best suits your circumstances. It you’re still not sure, talk to your physician or carry out more research. But you need to be clear on one point – the longer you delay, the more difficult your path to hair regrowth will be.</p>
