    <p>Many people are their own worst enemy when it comes to writing a good resume. It does not matter if they have a wonderful background, impeccable credentials or fabulous experience if their resume contains misused words, the wrong word tense or is not easily readable. Following is a series of resume writing tips from things I have seen on some people’s resumes that drive me “crazy:”</p>

<p>TIP 1: Do not be too focused on tasks and duties performed at work. Give yourself credit for accomplishment by including some achievements. Include such things as:</p>

<p>• Examples of how you performed the job better than others</p>

<p>• Some of the problems or challenges you faced and ways that you overcame them</p>

<p>• Results, results, and results</p>

<p>• Ways that the organization benefited from your performance</p>

<p>• Reference to awards, special recognition or promotions you received</p>

<p>TIP 2: An objective statement that is too wordy or non-specific. Over the years of working at with a resume service company, I’ve spoken with many CEO’s who have told me about candidates who lose their readers at the opening line. Statements like “A challenging position that enables me to contribute to organizational goals while offering an opportunity for growth and advancement” are cliché’, too generalized, and waste space. If you are on a career track, replace the objective with a statement stating what you do or something of your expertise.</p>

<p>Tip 3: Professional resumes should be concise and written in a telegraphic style without using “I” or “me.” Example: “Developed new products that added $5 million in sales and increased the company’s gross margin by 15 percent.” This style gets to the point quickly and communicates clearly.</p>

<p>Tip 4: Is it “percent” or “percentage?” Use the word “percent” with numbers, and use “percentage” without using a number. Examples: “Over 20 percent of our gross profit came from previous sales.” “A large percentage of Native Americans live in Alaska.”</p>

<p>Tip 5: Be careful in choosing the right word. Example: Some people write the word “balance” when they mean “remainder.” “Balance” means “a degree of equality,” e.g., “wanting to balance the checkbook.” “Remainder,” or “what is leftover,” is used in all other situations, e.g., “put the remainder of my food in the dog’s bowl.”</p>

<p>Tip 6: The expression “a couple of” is usually plural in meaning. Example: “A couple of customers have reported a shortage in their orders.” However, when using the phrases “a couple of days” and “a couple of dollars,” the verb used should be singular. When the phrase “a couple of” is used in conjunction with a period of time, amount of money, or quantity that represents a total amount, treat the expression as singular. Example: “All I need is a couple of days to complete this report.”</p>

<p>Do not let such easily correctable items stand between you and your next career assignment. If word tense, grammar or the turn of a phrase is not your forte’, consider hiring a professional resume writer. Such people write resumes for a living and the good ones guarantee their work. Landing the job makes such a move well worth it.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Back pain is the most common complaint among adults under 45. Back pain brings their activities to a complete halt and intervenes in the progress of their career. Researchers say that it is really a challenge to a physician to find out the true cause of back pain.</p>

<p>Here is a quick take on the anatomy of the human back. Our body depends on the spinal column for structural stability and mobility. We twist, bend and flex with the help of spinal column. The spinal column is made up of 24 vertebrae, 7 in the neck (the cervical vertebrae), 12 in the thorax (the thoracic vertebrae), and 5 in the lower back (the lumbar vertebrae). The sacrum, located just below the lumbar vertebrae, consists of 5 fused vertebrae. The tailbone, or coccyx, with its 3 to 5 fused vertebrae, lies just beneath the sacrum. These vertebrae are placed one on another from skull to pelvis. Spongy discs are present in between vertebrae .The spinal column is tightly wrapped by muscles and ligaments.</p>

<p>The spinal cord is enclosed within vertebral canal which is formed by alignment of vertebrae.</p>

<p>Acharya sushruta describes anatomy of spinal column as follows.</p>

<p>Prushte trimshat – The number of back bones are 30 (Cervical-7 , Thoracic – 12, Lumbar- 5, vertebrae fused in sacrum -5 , coccyx -</p>

<p>1 ). While describing the joints in spinal column it has been said as “ Chaturvimshatihi prishta vamshe “. This means there are 24 joints in spinal column.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>Maamsaanyatra nibaddhani siraabhihi snaayubhistatha.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Asthinyaalambanam kritwaa</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The ligaments and tendons hold the bones and muscles together.</p>

<p>Causes for back ache</p>

<p>Bones and thighs are mainly occupied by Vata . Vata controls and directs the body movements.Back pain occurs when vata in this region gets aggravated due to unwise physical activities (mithya yoga of karma), exaggerated physical activities (Ati yoga of karma ) or less physical activities (hina yoga of karma).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Back ache usually arises from spasm of muscles that support our spine. The muscles supporting spine go into spasm when we lift things unwisely, bending over too sharply, sitting in a unsuitable chair, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>These type of movements are called as “Mithyaa yoga of karma or action ” in ayurveda.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Back pain can be triggered when we sneeze, climb into a car, or bend down to pick up the newspaper.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, viral infection, bladder or kidney infection, gynecological problems in women, tumors and trauma may also cause back pain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lack of motion or hina yoga of karma and bad posture may affect us when we sit or stand for long periods of time. On the other hand repetitive motion or Ati yoga of karma like too much of bending, lifting or twisting also affects our back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other potential causes for back ache are:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>• Overweight</p>

<p>• Wearing high heeled shoes</p>

<p>• Carrying heavy weight</p>

<p>The vitiated vata causes stiffness of joints, pain and limits the movements of back.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Make Your Own Holiday Day. Choose one of the most flexible holidays. You can celebrate this day for any reason you wish. It is for you. Make a day to celebrate a day you have forgotten, or invent one for your fun. There is no compulsion and no common theme for the day. This day is for each of us to enjoy a holiday. I have not been able to find out how this tradition originated.</p>

<p>But is a great idea. Make a holiday today, if it is 26th March. Why not to expand the idea little further and begin celebrating many more days for no rhyme or reason but to enjoy and have fun? All right, we need not take a holiday from work on all such days, but can try to create a holiday-like atmosphere. Can this not be done? Let me elaborate. For example, I make 7th of every month a special day for myself. I work on that day, but try to bring in as much fun as possible. Throw parties, go walking, take life little less seriously and try to fill the day with as much joy as possible. I hope that I am making myself clear.</p>

<p>All of us have conditioned our minds. We will celebrate each holiday on a particular day and follow the particular tradition for that. Why? Why not to be little more inventive and create our own holidays along with other traditional ones? Imagine 12 more days a year full of fun and joy. Let me give another example. Say, I was born on the 10th July. Generally, I will celebrate my birthday on that day every year. Why cannot I call every 10th my birthday and have fun? No, I am not asking for presents for twelve birthdays, but at least nothing can stop me from treating friends? Nothing can stop me from enjoying the 10th of every month as my birthday and carry that cheer in my heart? I am not asking my friends to send me cards, but won’t they be happy to get from me saying thank you? or to say a Hello? Or wish Good Morning?</p>

<p>Only our attitude stops us from making a day cheerful for our friends and ourselves. This special day reminds us of the immense possibilities of human imagination to make our life a beautiful life. Best, let us make everyday a holiday. Let everyday be a holiday from worries and stress. Give tension a holiday everyday. Give a very long and permanent holiday to all those emotions such as jealousy, worry, stress, tension, and their friends.</p>

  </header>

    <p>In Hamlet, Shakespeare said it best: “Brevity is soul of wit.” When marketing a particular product, a buyer will lose interest if the benefits of the solution are not expressed in a clear and concise manner. Psychologically, buyers usually have a lot on their minds (as they have their own jobs and goals too) and want to get to the point. Too much information or elaboration on a certain topic can put a sales person in a position where the client purposely avoids them due to their conversations’ perceived length. If you want an example, call one of my family’s pet sitters (name confidential).</p>

<p>Question and Benefit Selling:</p>

<p>Either speaking in-person or over the phone, a good sales person asks the proper questions and uncovers the client’s needs in a timely, friendly and professional manner. They also always write down the client’s concerns in order to address them one by one. Knowing these requirements allows the sales representative to work with the buyer bit-by-bit to solve their problem via a tailored offering. In a meeting, it is the buyer, not the seller, who should control the situation.</p>

<p>Accessible Language with Supporting Evidence:</p>

<p>In nearly any complex sale, a sales person will deal with all different types of decision makers within a company. This can range from that stereotypical reserved CFO to the boisterous VP of Sales. No matter who they are, they will all understand catch phrases such as ‘hit it out of the ballpark’ or ‘we can give you a better price, however, as we all know, at that price, I feel that the resources we can allocate may be a swing and miss.’ These are aspects of everyday life, and to bring them to the negotiation/sales table can put everyone on the same page.</p>

<p>Efficient phone technique:</p>

<p>Nothing grabs the undivided attention of somebody purchasing a product better than a sales representative who speaks with a tone of voice that not only shows confidence in himself, but confidence in the product he or she is selling. Typically, I can tell a good salesperson within thirty seconds, due mainly to voice projection and confidence. Also, before a strong bond is formed with the client, intelligence and proper grammar are significant steps to becoming a respected part of that client’s business day and decision making process. Most importantly, good phone technique follows the old proverb straight and to the point.</p>

<p>Next time you make a cold or warm-call try saying, “Mr. Smith, my name is Bob Salesman; I’m calling from _<strong>_</strong>__ (maybe even add in what your company does). I do truly understand you are very busy, however could you give 30 seconds of your time? About a week ago, you came to my firm inquiring about x, y or z, and I’m hoping to set up a five minute phone conversation in the next few weeks to elaborate on our organization and better introduce myself.” Ink in the appointment and, prior to that next phone call, refer to the “Question and Benefit Selling” part of the article.</p>

<p>Industry Contacts:</p>

<p>In any industry, the easiest way to get in the door is to know the decision makers within your target market. These days, being able to sell to “C” level executives (the new Lexus of resume listings) is a skill in great demand. These contacts are formed over time through trust, careful relationship building and delivery of a product that the executive and her company perceive to be beneficial. The effective sales person realizes that these people are busy and that account manager must be on-call to see them whenever a free moment arises. If you want to know how to find out who these people are. Now, with the right wit and an ability to get past the gate keeper (sales term for assistant), you can build your own black book of important contacts.</p>

<p>Friendliness and Professionalism:</p>

<p>Good sales people represent their organization in a professional manner while reaping the benefits of establishing good relationships with their valuable client base. However, some of these aspects can backfire when making a sale or laying the groundwork for a “cross-sell” or future business. How can this go wrong? Occasionally, Account Representatives tend to have a very outgoing personality and can easily cross the bounds between a good working relationship and an outside friendship. The best friend tactic sometimes will work with occasional clients as they want to establish both a strong working and personal relationship with their sales representative. Other clients have their own interests and think of a sales person as only a minute (and possibly annoying) part of their work day. Unless the product and service is great, a professional faux pas can kiss just about any account goodbye.</p>

    <p>With the record-setting hurricane season, it is never too soon to begin preparing for the 2006 season, which has been predicted to have an above average number of hurricanes.</p>

<p>EHA has over 25 years of experience with mold related matters and can assist you with assessment of the property and your health concerns.</p>

<p>EHA’s teams of qualified professionals are ready to respond immediately with offices in West Palm Beach and Tampa Bay, Florida.</p>

<p>As public health consultants, our first concern is for the health and safety of the people who suffer through these unfortunate events. The potential for disease outbreaks and serious injury loom far after the threat of a major hurricane. As such, people affected by major weather events of catastrophic size must first be prepared to deal with the following conditions so critical to human survival including food, water and shelter.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Infectious diseases and chemical exposure – Diseases such as typhoid and cholera are associated with the consumption of contaminated food and water supplies due to flooding of sewers and sewage systems. Viral and parasitic diseases such as Hepatitis A and Cryptographically can also become major threats to the public’s health. Contaminated flood waters may also harbor toxic chemicals including pesticides and petroleum by-products.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CO- Carbon Monoxide intoxication – Precautions should be taken to ensure that adequate ventilation exists whenever running any gasoline powered engine such as, large pumps, generators or vehicles. Last year there were deaths associated with carbon monoxide intoxication in Florida.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Safe food and water – Often the most critical two items essential to survival, safe food and water are often in short supply during major catastrophes. Food that has not been properly refrigerated should not be consumed. Whenever possible, drink only boiled or bottled water. If boiling water is not practical, authorities recommend the use of chlorine bleach at a concentration of1/8 teaspoon per gallon of water, but be advised that some pathogenic organisms are resistant to this chemical treatment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mosquito transmitted diseases – Diseases such as Encephalitis and West Nile Virus can be of serious concern. Since most hurricanes occur during the summer months, when temperatures can be sweltering, the best line of defense is a mosquito repellent containing DEET or Picariin.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Long after a hurricane has passed, after basic survival has been assured and upon return to your property, the threat of mold looms. For this reason, we’ve listed our Emergency Prevention of Mold Damage &amp; Property Damage recommendations below to help provide you with the first steps you should take to limit mold damage.</p>
