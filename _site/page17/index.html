  </header>

    <p>Many conversations that I’ve had with friends and family about making it and creating a big dollar career or wealth plan was usually shot down by the age old line “I Don’t Have Time”.</p>

<p>Redirect into useful energy this thinking that you have no time.</p>

<p>Turn that excuse into a fuel supply.</p>

<p>Make it excite you. Have it start your engine.</p>

<p>Train your mind to take hold of your thoughts.</p>

<p>Instead you will release unlimited power to propel you like a rocket towards your goals.</p>

<p>In life we come to realize that during our childhood when we did something good it usually had a good outcome.</p>

<p>If you cleaned your room (action) you were usually rewarded by happy parents who gave you some treat (reaction).</p>

<p>For every action there is an equal reaction.</p>

<p>It is natural proven law.</p>

<p>This applies to you.</p>

<p>If anything motivates you, makes your “wheels” spin get that thank you dollar tree to grow in your yard.</p>

<p>Then just like ALL who have succeeded before you, ALL who have what you want, or You, who has ideas of achieving the lifestyle of your dreams will have to EXCLUDE this “I don’t have time” excuse from your brain file cabinet.</p>

<p>Why can I say this? Well, we all have proven daily that we do have time.</p>

<p>We are able to make time to manage work, family and friends.</p>

<p>Multi-task a number of concerns like cooking dinner, watch TV, have a drink, make a snack, sit on the couch to take 5 or 10 minutes to relax.</p>

<p>We can do all these things.</p>

<p>It is time that we control.</p>

<p>We have the choice to use this time to further our own personal causes.</p>

<p>Don’t let the minutes pass by!</p>

<p>We find time to indulge in many things like over eat, stay up late, socialize.</p>

<p>We find the time and energy to see fault or complain.</p>

<p>This powerful line of “I don’t have time” is really a special indicator that we really DO have the time but care to not apply ourselves.</p>

<p>When it comes down to developing your future, your awareness of careers, opportunities and dollar making programs coming across your path have to be given top priority attention.</p>

  </header>

    <p>There are an umpteen number of migraine and headache relief solutions available in the market. The remedies available vary from the natural therapies to the medicinal alternatives. The effect of these therapies may however differ from person to person, there is a need to identify which one suits best for you and choose accordingly.</p>

<p>Forms of Migraine and Headache Relief</p>

<p>Before funneling down these options for a suitable remedy, it is advisable to know the cause and triggering factors of the headache. For migraine in particular, headache is caused by hormonal fluctuations which cause blood vessels in the head and neck to contract and then dilate. This dilation of the blood vessels that causes headache, the first stage of which may last anywhere from minutes to days. This dilation accompanies changes in the interplay of hormones leading to contracted and then over-dilated blood vessels.</p>

<p>The effect of the remedies may differ from person to person, there is a need to identify which one suits best for you and choose accordingly. It is always advisable to consult a doctor and plan out the best method for you in regards to the treatment of your headaches. However, there still are certain temporary reliefs available but for permanent cure a doctor should be consulted.</p>

<p>For a short-term temporary relief certain things would fetch immediate results. To list a few: Have a bath or shower; lie down to rest in a dark room; avoid bright and flashing lights; put something cold on the back of your neck or your forehead; have a drink of water or natural juice; press on two pressure points at the back of your neck; avoid sources of stress in your life; take some vitamins.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Let’s clarify first, the basics of linking strategies. Then let’s take a look at how to use this linking strategy to have a high rank on the search engines lists.</p>

<p>Some elements must be clarified first of all: an outbound link is a link going out of a website. An inbound link is a link coming in from another site to yours. Reciprocal links are the links between two sites, often based on an agreement between the owner of the two websites. A link checker is a tool to check for broken links. Deep linking means linking to a web page other than a site’s home page.</p>

<p>Inbound links are sending visitors to a page from a website. It is a very good link, increasing the site’s traffic and fulfilling an important requirement for search engines algorithms. Outbound links are sending the visitors away from a website. Website owners are in very different positions facing the outbound links.</p>

<p>New windows can be opened, some are linking freely. For commercial websites, outbound links losing time and money. Outbound links can be a risk if the site is losing visitors and potential clients.</p>

<p>Other opinions are totally opposite: outbound links can improve the site ranking, increase the visitors’ number and there are also chances for the returns of many visitors.</p>

<p>As the web is becoming more commercial, deep linking becomes an important matter too. As the internet strength is to make a contact between a public document and information to another public document or information, the home page becomes very important to establish and maintain the brand and serving functions.</p>

<p>Deep linking is eliminating those advantages. There are also other opinions, consolidating the free modality to present information on a web site. A deep link is better than no link at all; an appropriate navigation structure can make the deep linking an advantage to clarity and functionality for a web site.</p>

<p>Reciprocal links are the result of an agreement between two site owners to have links to each other. The most frequent users of reciprocal links are the small/medium websites, searching for site’s popularity and willing to increase the site’s ranking.</p>

<p>Natural links extend a topic to a broader theme; they are always visible. Artificial links are adding value to the site’s owner, support a third party, but not the visitors. Artificial links, if they are illegitimate, are hidden from visitors. If artificial links are legitimate, they are at the bottom of the pages, usually places outside the primary areas of a web page.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2012/08/24/be-cautious-when-studying-mutual-fund-ratings/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Be Cautious When Studying Mutual Fund Ratings</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Wherever you look, you will find various rating systems on mutual funds, each of which uses a different approach. All of them are designed to weed through the thousands of funds to get to the best ones. But is there really such a thing? Does a high rating really mean a fund will do better in the future? Many people seem to think so. A recent study showed, North America’s most recognized rating system for funds, has a tremendous influence on fund sales. If it gives a five-star rating, those funds typically enjoy increased sales as a result.</p>

<p>While ranking providers are careful to warn investors that their ratings don’t foretell the future, the star system is, unfortunately, used by some investors as if they were reading Consumer Reports to purchase a new drill. Supporters of the ranking approach argue that there’s no subjective component to the star rating. It isn’t determined by an analyst’s review, and can’t change simply because the service dislikes the fund’s manager or its investment strategy. And that’s good.</p>

<p>Performance will vary. Fund performance often falls off and risk levels rise during the subsequent three years after a fund is given an initial five-star rating, suggests another recent study by Matthew Morey, a professor at Pace University. One reason for this is that after receiving a five-star rating the size of the fund grows dramatically, which then makes the fund unwieldy to manage, he suggests. Since Morey’s study was completed, and also has changed the way it doles out top rankings to make them more precise. One of the biggest problems with all rating systems is that they are not necessarily predictive in nature. This means they’re not really set up to tell you whether certain funds will necessarily do better in the future. For the most part, the ratings indicate how much you might have made and how much aggravation you faced in the process.</p>

<p>Combining risk and return. For example, one five-star fund might post moderate return scores, but incredibly low risk scores. Another five-star fund might have much higher-risk scores, but its return score could be strong enough to help it still rank in the top 10% of the pack.</p>

<p>In some cases, in fact, it’s not even the same fund to begin with. Remember, after a management change, the rating stays with the fund, not the portfolio manager. Therefore, a fund’s rating might be based almost entirely on the track record of a manager who is no longer with the fund.</p>

<p>Understand how the ratings were developed. Too many people put emphasis on the results without knowing how the results were achieved. If you are going to use ratings, take the time to understand how they were developed and what they really mean. It is not the destination but the journey that counts.</p>

<p>Past performance is no guarantee of the future. You have probably heard this disclaimer a thousand times before, but it is really important to understand. Most rating systems have little to no predictive element in them. It’s natural to think that the best performer of the past will be the best performer in the future. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. Just think about it; if it were that easy, investors would just continue to buy last year’s winners knowing that they will be this year’s winners. And that seldom works.</p>

<p>Ratings are a very important element in trying to distinguish between good and bad funds. Good research, however, goes far beyond just looking for five stars or an A+. When evaluating funds, look at the quantitative, measurable characteristics of a fund: returns up against the benchmark, costs, risks, taxes and manager tenure. Use rating systems as part of your research, but remember: just because the analysts give them top marks, it does not mean they will be the best investment in the future, and doesn’t it mean that they’ll be the best investment for you in particular. Take the time to understand how the ratings were achieved. This will be the first step to educating yourself about funds.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Change management is a process in the IT field that often involves a major transition of an organization or entity, from one state to another. These changes are not restricted to the organization alone; they also involve the individual employees and teams of the organization. Before embarking upon any change it is necessary to realize why the change is done, and what needs to be achieved because of it. This transition is done after some thoughtful planning and with careful implementation. The aim of change management is to efficiently make the necessary changes in the company, without having any adverse effects or consequences. As there are very few working environments that can actually ignore change, you can easily guess its importance. Change management helps in ensuring standardized methods and processes used for all changes, and forecasting and handling all problems that might arise with changes. Most of the problems arise when change is forced upon people; it needs to be realistic, over a period of time and achievable.</p>

<p>When any kind of change is being planned, these essential elements need to be remembered:</p>

<p>1.The psychology of change differs from individual to individual.</p>

<p>2.Everyone’s needs differ and have to be met.</p>

<p>3.With change comes a chance of loss.</p>

<p>4.No individual or organization can ignore change.</p>

<p>Change Management Purpose:</p>

<p>The main reason behind enforcing such a plan in your organization is to make sure the negative impact of the change is minimized. A change maybe optional or mandatory, for example to adhere to governmental policies is mandatory and needs to be followed by one and all. The purpose is to basically change the scope, schedule and other aspects of a particular project.</p>

<p>Change Management Process:</p>

<p>Organization change has been a rapid process over the past few decades, with technology and the Internet turning this world into a small place, you will find that there is faster and easier access to knowledge. Thus, change has become part of our lives. The change management process is a series of steps that a change management team would follow for the application of change management. There will be many times where organizations and individuals will encounter changing conditions, that they are powerless to control. This is why change is crucial and change management is essential. The faster and more efficient you are towards change, the more you will benefit. There are many plans and strategies one can follow to implement effective change in the organization. The process involves several sequences of steps that will help to control, track and manage change. One can record change requests, and review and approve those requests, before final implementation. It is also easy to monitor the real impact of these changes, which will make the future decisions of change management (if any) easier. Whichever strategy or plan is followed, one must keep in mind that communication is the essential key to effective change management, starting right from the top to the lowest.</p>

<p>A good change management process should adhere to the following:</p>

<p>1.Explores the feasibility of all the steps.</p>

<p>2.Explain in detail all the steps of the process.</p>

<p>3.Clearly explains the responsibility of each manager or project leader.</p>

<p>4.Describes the change review and approval process.</p>

<p>5.Systematically keep track of all the ideas implemented and their results.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why this kind of change management processes fails, one of the main reasons is lack of understanding by the management themselves. There are several stages or phases the organization or individual employees go through as soon as the process is started. They are:</p>

<p>1.Shock</p>

<p>2.Denial</p>

<p>3.Understanding</p>

<p>4.Acceptance</p>

<p>5.Learning</p>

<p>6.Implementing</p>

<p>The main reasons for failure of the process are:</p>

<p>1.Lack of top level commitment</p>

<p>2.Lack of vision and forecasting</p>

<p>3.Lack of clarity and communication</p>

<p>4.Ineffective implementation</p>

<p>5.Resistance to change by individuals</p>
