  </header>

    <p>While modern medicine claims listening to Johann Sebastian Bach can cure everything from headaches to general anxiety disorder, I believe it is only so if you enjoy J.S. Bach. I tend to enjoy Mozart, The Beatles, and numerous others better. There are certain songs for which I can listen by various artists that put me in a trance-like state. It is when I arrive here that I know I can easily think outside the box.</p>

<p>While music is a great instigator of creativity, nothing beats nature. I am fortunate in that I live on the edge of America’s oldest National Forest, but that was not always the case. Many times, I simply left my house with my dog and we went to the local park to play. Where there is nature such as greenery, trees, in other words, lack of buildings, noise and trees, is a great place to start.</p>

<p>Never leave the house without a pen and paper. You may think you will remember that great idea you had while listening to music, walking in the park of forest or park or even before you went to sleep; but always, and I mean always, keep that pen beside you. Though you may find that the majority of your ideas, as are mine, are useless, its the 10 or so brilliant percent that will take you where you want to be. You will never regret your friends, ink and paper.</p>

<p>Brainstorm, but brainstorm with someone you trust. At times, you may have to give them a piece of the action, depending on how much they have contributed and that is only fair. But sometimes you just need a sounding board to see if you are on the right track, and most close friends or family will do that for you at no cost.</p>

<p>If you are writing a song, poem or series of them, and hit a writers block, find a rhyming dictionary, a dictionary, thesaurus (or they are all online for free). There’s always an answer even if you don’t have it on the tip of your tongue.</p>

<p>If you run into a problem or obstacle write it down or type it into your computer. Just put it someplace where you can see it. Call a trusted friend or family member and let them know you have it typed on your screen and “What would they do” if they were in your situation; or, you may surprise yourself and figure it out on your own.</p>

<p>Take a walk or a hike or a jog. When you return, you’ll either have an answer or you will have forgotten what the issue or problem was in the first place.</p>

<p>Turn off the television, even if you love it. TV does ugly things to the creative brain. That’s not just me talking but many studies.</p>

<p>There can be a lure to take drugs or drink when/if things get tough. Ironically this is when you need that kind of stimulation the least. To you, you may seem to be the most creative person in the world when under the influence…to others you just seem under the influence.</p>

<p>Become a voracious reader. Read especially biographies and autobiographies of persons who have achieved what it is you are trying to accomplished. You might be surprised how much these creators and inventors reveal about themselves and the tricks of the trade.</p>

<p>Argue. That’s right argue. Debate. All of these are “brain exercises”. They do not mean you are attacking someone or questioning their character. By debating other points of view are available to you and it is the perfect brain exercise. The brain is like a muscle. If you are not constantly working, then get with another person or persons and argue or hold a lively conversation. You will come home that much smarter.</p>

<p>Like Walt Disney, if you are embarking up on a creative endeavor, don’t count on the local bank to open its vault to you (though it may). Chances are you will have to have patience, persistence, and</p>

<p>friends support on your side. You are in it for the long haul. You will most likely come across many obstacles. Obstacles are your friends because you will learn from them. Similar incidences may evolve in the future but you will instinctively know how to handle them.</p>

<p>Don’t force it. The more you pursue something the more it runs the other way. That includes fame, money, friends, lovers, wives, husbands…you name it. Just sit back and begin enjoying the process doing little bits on your project at a time. If you have a job, don’t quit it yet. Just spend a few hours a day on your creative venture.</p>

  </header>

    <p>For some people, allergies are a seasonal condition, recurring for several weeks at the same time period each year. This condition is called seasonal allergic rhinitis. In the spring pollen levels rise as trees and flowers begin to bloom causing sneezing, runny nose, itchy watery eyes and nasal congestion. For others, these allergy symptoms are a daily nuisance that can occur throughout the year, a condition known as perennial allergic rhinitis.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you don’t have to be a helpless victim to these seasonal or perennial allergic symptoms. Here are certain lifestyle changes recommended by the allergy experts that can help you reduce your symptoms and control your allergy: (box text under Lifestyle Changes</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Keep pets out of the bedroom or even outdoors if possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Replace your humidifier, vacuum cleaner and furnace filters often.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wash bedding weekly, place zipped covers over mattresses, box springs and pillows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remove dust collectors, such as carpeting, old drapes and overstuffed furniture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid cigarette smoking in the house.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remove house plants that may be a source of mould and dust mites.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During pollen season, close the windows of your home in late afternoon and on hot, dry, windy days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Schedule outdoor activities for late afternoon or evening when pollen release is at its lowest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Non-sedating antihistamines can help you reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis and let you perform normally. Make sure to look for the words “non-drowsy” on the package to ensure that it’s a non-sedating medication.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep informed of pollen levels in your area when planning outdoor activities or to pre-treat your allergy by tuning in to every 28 minutes past the hour on the Weather Network.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  </header>

    <p>A man rushed into a veterinarian’s office carrying his limp, lifeless dog. The vet examined the animal and told the man the dog was dead. The man asked if there was any way the doctor could revive the dog. The doctor left the room and returned with a cat, who sniffed the dog from head to tail then looked up at the vet and meowed.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said the doctor. “There’s nothing I can do.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for trying,” said the man with a sigh. “How much do I owe you?”</p>

<p>“Three hundred and fifty dollars,” replied the doctor.</p>

<p>“Three hundred and fifty dollars! Just to tell me my dog is dead?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the doctor, “it was $50 for the office visit. The other $300 is for the CAT scan.”</p>

<p>Whether the above joke made you laugh or groan, it lightened your mood. And if you had been in pain, many scientists agree, it would have eased the hurt—at least temporarily.</p>

<p>A fresh take on an old idea</p>

<p>The notion that laughter is good for the body has been around for thousands of years—certainly as far back as the Old Testament. Proverbs 17:22 says, “A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.”</p>

<p>Seventeenth century English physician Dr. Thomas Sydenham remarked, “The arrival of a good clown exercises more beneficial influence upon the health of a town than of twenty asses laden with drugs.” Or as Groucho Marx put it, “A clown is like aspirin, only he works twice as fast.”</p>

<p>How do you get a sweet 80-year-old lady to say the F word? Get another sweet little 80-year-old lady to yell *BINGO*!</p>

<p>The value of laughter in helping to relieve pain began to attract significant attention in the 1980s when Dr. Norman Cousins in his book Anatomy of an Illness described how watching Marx Brother movies and reading humorous books and articles helped him recover from a life-threatening tissue disease.</p>

<p>Cousins made it a point to enjoy a hearty belly laugh several times a day. He claimed that a few minutes of laughter gave him an hour or more of pain-free sleep. As a result, many pain centers around the country began to use humor therapy to reduce the level of pain medication needed by patients.</p>

<p>There was even a movie made about real-life doctor Patch Adams, a physician who was totally committed to making his patients laugh as an essential part of his treatment.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2014/05/12/parents-dealing-with-worry-and-fear/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Parents Dealing with Worry and Fear</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>This column offers solutions to people who write in questions about how they can solve their life challenges through the formula described in the books, Way of the Positive Flow and Positive Flow Parenting.</p>

<p>Someone says, I worry about not being a good parent. My daughter Tracy is six and my son Michael is four. They seem happy. Our family does things together. It is just that with so much that seems to be going wrong in the world, I fear that something will go wrong at home.</p>

<p>This really isn’t a parenting question. It is a question about your own self and how you relate to life. Your children are simply the catalyst for energizing these issues for you. The fact that your feelings of unrest are manifesting in the guise of concern for your children just proves that negative energies don’t play fair. They go for our soft spots, and they have no mercy.</p>

<p>You told me your story perfectly. But, you only needed to use two of the words you wrote: Worry and Fear. These are words that become self-fulfilling. The more you use them, the more powerful they become.</p>

<p>Whenever you have reoccurring feelings or emotions that get in the way of your personal sense of internal balance you are doing yourself and your whole family a favor by doing something to improve your mental/emotional landscape.</p>

<p>You have taken the first big step by recognizing that this area of your life is out of balance. Observation is key to knowing what is going on in life. Next you want to come up with creative solutions to your situation. Remember, you aren’t trying to go to war with yourself over this issue. What you are trying to do is redirect energy that is heading in what you would consider to be a negative direction, and turn it towards a positive direction.</p>

<p>Here is an idea to show you how this works:</p>

<p>Go on a diet. Not a food diet, but a worry/fear diet. That means you consciously abstain from worrying or being fearful for periods of time. Of course as soon as you go on a diet (as with food) you become intensely aware of the very thing that you are trying to forget!</p>

<p>The key is to remember that you aren’t trying to fight with yourself. You are trying to redirect negative energy into a positive direction.</p>

<p>If you take some quiet time to search inside yourself for creative ideas I bet you will come up with some fun and inventive ways that fit your own situation perfectly. If you get stuck for ideas, do a little brainstorming with a good friend.</p>

<p>Tip: You don’t have to tell your friend that you are driving yourself nuts with worry/fear. That could create a negative image in their mind. Just tell them truthfully that you are looking for some fun ways to redirect your energies when you feel the need. They may end up trying the ideas themselves!</p>

<p>When you notice that you are starting to worry or be fearful (you want to catch yourself as quickly as possible before you build up a head of steam) then go directly to one of your redirection ideas. If the first one doesn’t work, move right on to the next idea.</p>

<p>Here are some sample ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Make silly faces in the mirror.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exercise intensely. Activities that take mental, as well as, physical effort are particularly good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do a good deed for someone. Intense attention to others often takes us out of self-involved circles of thought.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read the comics or a good book of humor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Listen to joyful music.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Watch a light, happy movie.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn to meditate. Meditation is the most direct way to internally redirect our energies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Affirm: I am joyful and energetic! Repeat this out loud ten to twenty times while walking in place and swinging your arms.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When you immerse yourself in almost any positive direction with energy and concentration you will find that negative energies lose their power and eventually fall away through neglect. This is a powerful truth that works in every facet of life.</p>

<p>Experiment with these ideas and let us know how things go.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Warm summer days filled with bright sunshine aren’t always good for you. Over exposure to sunlight can cause serious sunburn, pain and the long-term risk of skin cancer. St. John Ambulance, Canada’s leader in safety-oriented™ first aid training and products, points out that you can still enjoy sun if you reduce risk by taking precautions.</p>

<p>People with fair skin are most susceptible to sunburns. However, no matter what the skin type, the harmful effects of the sun, such as sunburn, can be sustained by anyone.</p>

<p>Prevention is your best defense. Use a sunscreen strong enough to block out harmful rays. Remember to apply it liberally many times over the course of a day in the sun as it will soak into skin, evaporate and be washed off in water.</p>

<p>Don’t stay outdoors for extended periods without covering exposed skin. Never leave tender skin exposed for more than a few minutes at a time. Wear a light, sun repellent cover over bathing suits or other light clothing. Always keep your head and eyes protected.</p>

<p>First Aid for sunburn</p>

<p>Sunburns can be very serious. Ranging from mild discomfort to severe burning over a large portion of the body, extreme sunburn can be further complicated by heatstroke. For minor sunburn, St. John Ambulance suggests the following first aid:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Check the casualty thoroughly to determine the extent and severity of the burn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get out of the sun immediately.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cover the burn with a wet towel or gently sponge the area with cool water to relieve pain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pat the skin dry and apply medicated sunburn ointment or lotion. Apply according to directions on the package and watch for warning signs of an allergic reaction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protect burnt areas from further exposure to the sun.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t break blisters – doing so may promote infection. If large areas of the skin begin to blister, seek medical help.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the casualty begins to vomit or develops a fever, give first aid for heatstroke and get medical help.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

    <p>Save Water Indoors:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Install faucet aerators. Faucet aerators are cheap and easy to install, and can quickly improve the water efficiency of your faucet. Faucet aerators come in flows rates as low as 1 gallon per minute, versus the standard 2.5 gallons per minute, which cuts your water use by more than 50% while still providing a good water stream. Here is a step by step guide on how to install them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check for leaky faucets and toilets. Leaky faucets and toilets are big water wasters, yet they can be very easy to fix. If you are not sure if your toilet is leaking, add food coloring or a dye tablet into the water in the back tank. After waiting for 15 or so minutes, check to see if you see any of the dye color in the toilet bowl. If you do, it means your toilet flapper is leaking, wasting thousands of gallons a year.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some cheap fixes: Toilet Tune Up Kit, Drip stop Valve</p>

<p>(*Note: Does your toilet only leak at night? Many toilets really do run only at night; that’s because people use much less water during these hours and in many municipal water systems, the water pressure rises considerably during this time. It is not uncommon for system water pressure to rise by 15 to 20 pounds per square inch (psi), and by as much as 30 psi in some situations. This rise in pressure could cause water creep inside your gravity-fed tank by 1/2 inch or more.</p>

<p>Quick fix: Adjust the float in your toilet tank so that the water level is lower. This will prevent the added water pressure from causing water overflow into the bowl.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If you have an old toilet that you don’t want to replace, which uses 3 gallons per flush or more, install a toilet bag. Toilet bags, like the Toilet Tummy, offset water inside the tank, reducing the amount of water used per flush.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shorten your showers by using a shower timer. Even a one or two minute reduction can save up to 700 gallons per month.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t defrost food using running water. Defrost foods overnight in the refrigerator or use the microwave.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run the dishwasher only when full (2-4.5 gallons per load)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run only full loads of laundry (15-50 gallons per load)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Save Water Outdoors:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Water only before 6am and after 8pm to reduce evaporation and water loss from wind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plat regional or drought-resistant plants. Whether you are putting in a new landscape or slowly changing the current landscaping at your home, select plants that are appropriate for your local climate conditions. Having a yard with 100% lawn or turf area in a dry desert climate uses significant amounts of water. It takes 55 inches of water per year to keep grass green, yet in drier southwestern US climates, the average annual rainfall is 10 inches or less.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use a broom instead of a hose to clean driveways. Saves 150 gallons each time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t leave the hose running while washing your car. Use an automatic shut-off nozzle. Saves 150 gallons each time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reduce irrigation time by 1-3 minutes, or eliminate one irrigation cycle per week. Watering every day is usually not necessary. Step on your grass. If it springs back when you lift your foot, it doesn’t need water. Saves 750-1,500 gallons per month!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have a pools and/or a spa? Use an insulated cover to cut down on evaporation. Covers on spas also keep the heat in, reducing the energy cost of re-heating the water to a toast 102 degrees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use mulch in your flowerbeds and exposed ground. There are many different types of mulch, from wood chips, to rock, to other types of organic materials. It can be purchased cheaply and sometimes can be obtained for free. Mulch reduces water evaporation from the soil, keeping it moist for your plants and flowers, allowing you to water less frequently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be vigilant about adjusting your sprinklers so that you are watering your grass or landscape, NOT the sidewalk. Saves 500 gallons per month.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2014/04/15/mind-control-myths-and-secrets/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Mind Control Myths and Secrets!</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>If I say the words “mind control”, what pops into your head?</p>

<p>Science fiction ray-guns, maybe, or a sinister-looking hypnotist murmuring “You are in my power”..?</p>

<p>Well, let’s kick those myths and stereotypes straight out! No device has yet been invented allowing you to control other people’s minds and make them do anything you want.</p>

<p>Neither can a hypnotist force you to do anything against your will. All a hypnotist does is guide you into a hypnotic state. The hypnotist may make suggestions, but you always have the power to reject these if they conflict with your moral code.</p>

<p>But there ARE mind control techniques you can use on yourself (and others) to help achieve desired goals, e.g. boosting self-confidence or overcoming inhibitions. These methods work by by-passing the conscious mind and communicating directly with the subconscious.</p>

<p>What is the subconscious?</p>

<p>It’s the part of our brain that controls our deepest-seated habits and behavior. The subconscious absorbs any messages that reach it and uses them to build new thought-patterns and behaviors. If you want to achieve real, deep-seated change, it MUST take place at a subconscious level.</p>

<p>One of the best ways of accessing the subconscious directly is subliminal messaging. Subliminal messages are transmitted below an individual’s normal threshold of perception. For example, a visual message might be shown very briefly and not seen by a person consciously, yet perceived by them at an subconscious level.</p>

<p>You might ask what’s the value of sending a message if the person isn’t aware of receiving it…</p>

<p>And yet, that’s EXACTLY what makes subliminal messaging so powerful. Our critically-aware conscious mind normally filters out most of the many messages we receive every day, so they have no influence on us. Subliminal messages by-pass the conscious mind and go straight to the subconscious, where they can have a real and lasting impact.</p>

<p>To use subliminal for self-development, of course, you need a method for administering the messages so you aren’t consciously aware of them. There are several possibilities, but in this article I’d like to spotlight the Subliminal Power software.</p>

<p>Subliminal Power comes loaded with hundreds of subliminal messaging scripts. You simply select the ones you want – e.g. improve your memory – and the program flashes up messages on your PC screen. These are too brief to see consciously, so they go straight to your subconscious, where they immediately start to “re-program” your mind with the thought-patterns you desire.</p>

<p>But maybe you’d prefer your subliminal delivered through your ears rather than your eyes? Then subliminal CDs could be the answer…</p>

<p>This method has the advantage that you don’t have to be looking at your computer screen, or even be near a computer at all. Most subliminal CDs can be played on any audio device.</p>

<p>As with visual methods, subliminal CDs work by sending positive affirmations directly to the subconscious. There are many ways to achieve this. The most common is the “background whisper”, where the conscious mind only hears part of the message, but the subconscious compensates and pieces together the whole message, accepting it as a “mental command.” Other powerful techniques include stereo confusion, reverse messages, and silent sound.</p>

<p>It’s important to note, though, that not all subliminal CDs are the same.</p>

<p>In particular, many CDs sold commercially use just ONE of the methods mentioned above.</p>

<p>We’re all different, however, and a method that works well for one person may be barely effective with another. It must make sense, therefore, to combine all the most effective methods on one CD. And that’s just what Subliminal-CDs.com have down with their award-winning range of subliminal CD recordings.</p>

<p>The site is officially the Web’s largest subliminal CD and MP3 store, and it offers over 120 powerful subliminal recordings, all professionally produced using the unique 5-part Encoding System™ developed by Bradley Thompson.</p>

<p>Whatever your goal, from beating depression to increasing your confidence with the opposite sex, at Subliminal CDs you are certain to find a product that will help you achieve this.</p>

<p>But maybe you want to take things one step further and create your own tailor-made CDs – for your own use, or to give (or sell) to others.</p>

<p>With Subliminal-Studio you can create your own subliminal CDs, using exactly the same mechanisms as in the company’s Subliminal-CDs.com recordings.</p>

<p>To guide you, you get a book by self-development guru Bradley Thompson, “Developing your own Subliminal-Studio”. This takes you through the process of creating your own subliminal recordings, step-by-step.</p>

<p>In addition, you’ll also receive Subliminal-Studio software CD. This contains all the tools and resources you need to create your own subliminal CDs in literally minutes.</p>

<p>It includes royalty-free background music, 2 hours of bin-aural beats, 2½ hours of sounds from nature, 22 professionally recorded subliminal scripts in MP3 format, and a sought-after script for creating your own silent subliminal (a VERY powerful technique). You also get a trial version of Adobe Audition for compiling your recordings.</p>

<p>A royalty-free license is provided with all the audio resources. That means you can retail your own commercial recordings at no extra cost. You could sell the CDs you produce with this package at craft fairs, for example, or through an eBay shop.</p>

<p>Make no mistake: The mind control techniques revealed here may sound simple, but they are EXTREMELY powerful.</p>

<p>By following my advice, and with a little help from these excellent tools, you really can take control of your mind and re-program it to achieve almost anything you desire. Not only that, if you wish you can produce your own mind control products that will help others do likewise.</p>

<p>Good luck, and enjoy the amazing mind control power.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2014/04/03/how-far-have-we-really-come/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">How Far Have We Really Come?</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Women have come a long way over the past several decades: more parity in salaries, more options in career, more freedom in lifestyle choices. But how far have we come in our underlying self-esteem?</p>

<p>It’s amazing that so many of us still have areas in which we feel inadequate, maybe even powerless. We can be CEOs, doctors, US Senators – but we still might cringe at trying (and being initially klutzy at) a new sport, showing our imperfect legs in shorts, or asking for a long-overdue raise. We can negotiate fiercely in the Board room – but put up with lousy haircuts for months before we get up the nerve to “fire” our hairdresser. We sit “small” in our airplane seats, not wanting to take up too much space.</p>

<p>Self-esteem is not the same as assertiveness. Assertiveness is a behavior; self-esteem is the underlying feeling of worthiness, value, even self-love. Many of us in business or sports or other competitive arenas have learned to be assertive – but as a survival mechanism, not necessarily from an underlying sense of healthy self-esteem.</p>

<p>That gap between how we are acting – assertively – and how we are feeling – undeserving or unworthy – causes an internal tension, a feeling of in-congruence, and definitely less effectiveness in our performance and in our lives. By trying to “fake it until we make it,” we set ourselves up to never make it at all!</p>

<p>And though our lack of self-esteem as women may be rooted in past signals from our family, underlying messages in our culture, etc, etc, etc – the power to improve our self image is in the present moment. Past conditioning can be corrected by re-conditioning in the present.</p>

<p>How to do this? The first step is awareness and acknowledgment. Do you feel like you are “in the way” on the golf course? Do you feel timid telling your doctor that you want a second opinion? Or when you do gird yourself up to confront a situation at the office, does it take an incredible toll on your body and emotions?</p>

<p>Once you’ve identified the areas where you self-esteem is lagging, try this practice:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>With eyes closed, sit quietly and bring to mind the situation where you’ve felt unworthy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allow yourself to feel into the picture in your mind. How does it feel in your body? Where exactly is the feeling located in your body?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a few minutes, turn your attention to your breathing, your deep inhales and complete exhales.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you allow your body to relax into your breathing, imagine yourself in that same situation but as a new, truly self-confidant and empowered you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sit with this new picture of yourself for a few minutes, breathing deeply.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>While doing this practice, if your new picture is not perfect, don’t despair! You will have already caused a shift in your sense of self simply by acknowledging and breathing through your old discomfort. Play with the technique, and you’ll notice how much more vibrant the self-confidant images of yourself become – and how powerfully this simple practice will impact your life!</p>
