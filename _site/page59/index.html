  </header>

    <p>When your teeth becomes yellowish, you become more concerned since you feel that you are not  presentable when you smile. It is a common feeling that each one of us  have in this modern world of increased socialization. I read an article recently that explains the ways and means of maintaining your teeth white with outgoing to the clinic.</p>

<p>The discoloration of the teeth is due to non cleaning of the teeth after food and taking coffee and tea. The stains develop if it is not cleaned regularly. The easiest method is to go in for the tooth paste that are added with the solution for whitening the teeth. Since we brush every day, the continued usage of such type of tooth pastes will remove the stains over a period of time.</p>

<p>Also, teeth whitening strips are also available in the market and the same can be put on the teeth during the nighttime so that, it can remove the stain easily. They contain the solution that is active against the discoloration. In fact, the strips can be used even during the daytime as other cannot identify the same.</p>

<p>The teeth whitening trays are also now in use and the same is also available in the market for use at home. Instead of spending heavy amounts for removing the stains by going to the Doctor, we can easily get rid of the same staying at home by adopting to the means described in the foregoing lines.</p>

<p>As a common practice it is better that we constantly follow the regular brushing of our teeth and cleaning after taking food and beverages. Our dependence on the chemical solutions to remove the stain must be reduced to have healthy and white teeth.</p>

    <p>When I read the news in a newspaper regarding the frauds that are taking place using e-mail and mobile, it led to the fear whether the so-called technological gadgets are really worth owning and using. Of late many banks frauds are taking place through the net banking where the money is siphoned off from the accounts if gullible account holders.</p>

<p>The fraudsters are able to create the web site similar to the one created by the banks and cheat the account holders by calling for the id and the password in the pretext of changing the same. Recent events are also disclosing such a Cyber crimes in the field of job offer. E-mail ids of leading companies are imitated and the job offer is made on lucrative terms. The applicant is demanded with the hefty sums as the processing charges for the visa and other incidental charges and ultimately he is duped.</p>

<p>In the present day world such attacks by the Cyber criminals have intensified recently. It is fuelled by the growing use of the internet and mobile phones and the general desperation caused by an economic downturn globally that has left millions jobless. It is advisable that we are cautious of such mails and wrong communication to avoid the chance of becoming the victims of such frauds.</p>

    <p>The research activity in the space is attempted relentlessly by many leading nations for the scientific exploration of the space. This attempt is aimed at finding out the presence of life in various planets and also to study the various wealth hidden ion the surface of the earth. Most of the research at present are concentrated to improve the communication facilities via satellites.</p>

<p>The International Space Station also an important step towards this objective where in few nations joined together to develop the research facility. The research facility is assembled in the low earth orbit. The work for the International Space Station began by 1998 and the station is expected to function until 2015 and can be operative even up to 2020 as predicted. In fact, the ISS is said to be by far the largest artificial satellite, which serves as the research laboratory.</p>

<p>ISS has a microgravity environment where in the crews are able to conduct experiments in on various subjects like biology, physics astronomy human biology and a lot on meteorology. It is a matter of pride for the human kind that the programmer in ISS is approaching the record 10 years of operation by 23rd Oct2010. Though the scientific advancement creates certain disasters also, it is a must that the scientific world aims at using such facilities to help the humans for the progress in the right path.</p>

    <p>It is so sad that we are coming across lots of natural calamities like the one happened at Haiti, and China. While the developed countries with economic prosperity are able to tackle the issue on their own, many nations wait for the aide from others. In the case of Haiti earth quake, many governments, charitable and non-profit organizations from around the world began coordinating various types of humanitarian aid to help the Haitian people.</p>

<p>It is heartening to note that as much as $2.50 billion has been given to the rescue of the people at Haiti to come out of the earth quake issue until March 2010. Apart from the funding to give relief to the affected people, good amount of materials were also given by the nations like United States, UK, Canada Italy and Brazil.</p>

<p>Recently we observe so many east Asian countries are facing the wrath of nature by undergoing the impact of earth quake and flood. It is high time that an international body is created exclusively to tackle the issue of natural calamity. This entity should have a common fund contributed on regular basis by all the nations to meet out the eventuality. Such organization should bring together all the nations to discuss on the issue of environment to every such disasters in the future by following certain limit in the exploitation of the nature.</p>

  </header>

    <p>When every one of us felt relieved after the global economic crisis that destabilized the world economy soon after the collapse of Lehman brothers, the present European crisis started hitting badly. The main reason attributed by the economists is the interconnected government debt owned within Europe. European economy is found to be very slow now and is bound to hit the global demand.</p>

<p>To begin with the European economy is bound to get affected if not the needed stimulus is infused. As I read elsewhere, this may have adverse impact on the Asian economy also if proper curative measures are not taken. The overheated Chinese economy is also creating concern among the economists worldwide which may result in an asset bubble. Tightening policy by the Chinese is feared to be a major factor driving the stock market worldwide towards negative territory.</p>

<p>One more country which I feel may affect the global economy is the present status of Japan. The prediction is that, Japan will be impacted by the concerns about China growth slowing and is likely to have a government debt crisis as the government debt in Japan is 12% of GDP. As many leading economists predict, the crisis that has hit Europe may unfold to move to Japan and then it will finally hit the US. But the solace remains in the fact that each nation is feeling the pinch and is aggressively trying to avert such global disaster.</p>

  </header>

    <p>It may sound a cow boy joke, but one has to trust and believe. Yes, the cows can run the data center of leading IT giants like Google and Microsoft. The recent study by engineers from Hewlett and Packard revealed that, the fuel from the cattle waste can easily run the data-centers in a greener and most profitable way.</p>

<p>In their research paper, they have come out with the findings that the waste per day from a cow can run a 100 watts light-bulb. As such, as many as 10000 cows can produce the waste that is more than sufficient to cater to the energy need of the data center of a bank.</p>

<p>In the USA it is reported that the IT companies are in search of suitable farm lands in the rural areas adjoining the cattle farms to exploit this energy source. If it is stabilized, the bio fuel from the farm and cattle waste can be put in to best use to meet out the energy needs of the IT companies and taking care of the environmental protection.</p>

<p>It is also suggested that such corporate houses can go in for the diversification in the farming sector to enhance the opportunity to use the farm waste for their energy needs.</p>

    <p>Taste of sweet is found to bring the bitterness in many ways in our life as found by various research. The awareness on the ill effect of sugar on the human health is almost discussed every minute around the globe. Right from the impact on the kidney and ultimate multi organ failure, the research is going on to study the adverse impact of increased level of sugar in the blood.</p>

<p>Recent study by experts from Flinders University, has come out with yet another shocking revelation on the impact of abnormal sugar level in the body. The study cautions that, the inclination towards more and more chocolate and ice cream with a lot of sweetness lead to affect the brain.</p>

<p>Consuming foodstuff with more sweetness can lead to the consequences ranging from the simple memory lapse to car crashes according to the researchers the memory lapse is found to increase with the increasing level of sweet as tested in the laboratory. Hence, it is up to us to avoid the sweet beyond a level and ensure better memory.</p>

  </header>

    <p>When the financial management is not adhered to properly, we have to face many more European crisis. For an ordinary citizen, the impact of such crisis is something enormous. The international impact is also a matter of concern. Many countries who are dependent on the European countries for their trade get affected easily due to the slumping market. The share markets worldwide too got affected. As a layman one could easily assign various reasons for such debacle.</p>

<p>The failure on the part of the policy makers and the regulator can be the first and foremost reason for the present status of the affair. The recent crisis in Greece was averted to some extent owing to the infusion of about $ one trillion jointly by IMF and the European Union. In fact, the financial crisis has confirmed that the so-called economic prosperity in the euro zone was not a reality, but an illusion. The ultimate results is the weakening of the euro impacting the strength of other currencies too. Out of the 16 members of the European Union countries like Germany, France and the Netherlands re found to be having reasonable financial health while the remaining are not out of the wood.</p>

<p>It is a matter of grave concern that countries such as Spain and Portugal, faced with predicaments similar to the one in Greece, are still at risk of sovereign debt default. To bail out them the present infusion made. But the concern is that, how far such nursing can go ahead if most of the nations face such situation. It is better that each country formulate their own policies and regulations to ensure healthy banking system that is the fundamental need for the prosperity of any country. Such systems in place will certain to avert such disasters in the future and the common man will not suffer any more.</p>
