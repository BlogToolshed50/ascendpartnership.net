  </header>

    <p>A simple, “preventative maintenance” lawn care plan will keep your lawn in top shape all year ’round</p>

<p>Just follow these 10 easy steps to keep your lawn at its best:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Start with a good soil preparation. If you’re starting a new lawn, you’ll never regret the investment you make now in improving the soil. Grass grows best in a well-drained blend of topsoil, sand and organic matter several inches deep. Remove any hard packed snow patches and rake out old thatch to allow the grass to “breathe”. Top up with a specially formulated soil for lawns such as Hill view Top Dresser or Green Earth Premium Compost.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seed if necessary. As with fertilizer, buying quality grass seed pays off in a thicker lawn. Use a good quality mixture such as C-I-L ‘Golfgreen’ to patch bare spots, or spread overall late in fall or early spring. Rake lightly to ensure the seed contacts the soil, apply a starter fertilizer and water as necessary to keep the lawn from drying out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Control crabgrass. (Mainly in Ontario) If crabgrass was a problem last year, apply a Crabgrass Prevented in early spring to control crabgrass as it starts to germinate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Control broad leaf weeds. Weeds like dandelion, plantain, chickweed and others compete with grass for soil nutrients… and they usually win. If your lawn has a few weeds, spot-treat them with Lawn Weed Out. But if your lawn is over-run with weeds, then a “Weed &amp; Feed” fertilizer is your best bet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Water…but only if needed. Don’t be afraid to let the top surface of the soil dry out…this will encourage deep-rooted, stress-tolerant grass.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Control insects. White grubs, clinch bugs, leather-jackets, ants, wire worms and many common insects could destroy your lawn if conditions favor them. Try this: Cut off both ends of a coffee tin, sink half way into the lawn, and fill with water. If several clinch bugs make their way to the surface, apply a lawn insect control product such as C-I-L Grub Out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the correct mower height. In dry summer weather, let the lawn grow out a bit, and then cut with the lawn mower set up higher. In the fall, cut shorter again to avoid giving turf diseases a place to develop in the foliage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you don’t need to control weeds or insects, don’t. Application of a regular lawn fertilizer like Golden Vigor 24-4-8 every 10 to 12 weeks may be all you need to keep your lawn healthy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rake leaves so the grass can breathe. Chopped up, they make a great mulch for gardens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t forget to feed in the fall. It’s one of the most important feedings. For strengthening turf over the winter, use a fertilizer with less nitrogen than a spring fertilizer, but higher potash levels. The nitrogen stays put under the snow cover, ready for a quick start in the spring</p>
  </li>
</ol>

    <p>Three thousand parts. According to the National Association of Home Builders, that’s what the typical home contains. And when you’re building a home, you’re faced with hundreds of decisions regarding those 3,000 parts. One or two car garage? Carpet or hardwood floors? White or oak cabinets? Paint or wallpaper? Chrome or polished brass fixtures? And the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>While these questions may seem overwhelming at first, it’s important to take your time and closely consider each decision you make. And it’s not just the major choices that matter when building a home. Equally important, if not more so, are the smaller decisions, such as accessories. Items such as lighting, towel bars, glass shelves and more can make all the difference in a room’s decor.</p>

<p>These items make a significant difference in particular areas of the home, especially the bathroom. “A bathroom is a reflection of a homeowner’s personal style. Our research shows consumers truly seek an emotional benefit from their baths … a sense of comfort, serenity, and of style. The right accessories and finishing touches can add these feelings to the bath in an instant.”</p>

<p>But, how do you know where to start? Do certain accessories match a specific decorating theme? What accessory options are available? Read on as we explore the world of accessories.</p>

<p>Accessories 101</p>

<p>We all know that an outfit isn’t quite complete until you add the finishing touches. A vintage belt, stylish glasses or brand-new necklace can tie an ensemble together and give it a unique style. So, why stop with your clothing? The right mix of accessories, combined with a splash of creativity, can really make a house a home and show off your own unique style.</p>

<p>But how do you actually accessorize your home?</p>

<p>Once you have a style chosen for your home, how do you translate that into the bath? Where do you start? And what types of accessories should be chosen?</p>

<p>An important tip, is to remember there are no rules when it comes to accessorizing the bath. “If your family room and kitchen are decorated in a traditional theme, it doesn’t mean you necessarily have to accessorize your bathroom in the same style. It’s a personal decision — experiment with different looks and determine which style combination works best for your home.”</p>

<p>In terms of accessorizing the bath, where should you start? Recently, two well-known designers for their “words of wisdom” when it comes to creating different looks in the bath, simply with accessories.</p>

<p>International and Rooms of America, a consumer research organization, determined 74 percent of those surveyed believe style is “very important” to “extremely important” in their overall decorating decisions.</p>

<p>In terms of specific style preferences, the survey found consumers typically decorate in three primary thematic approaches: country, casual/contemporary and traditional. Thirty-eight percent of the population decorates in a casual style (also referred to as contemporary); following closely behind, 35 percent of consumers choose a traditional style of decorating; lastly, 27 percent of Americans decorate in a country theme, which includes secondary themes such as Shaker, Country French and Mission.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The first design decision to be made in any bath is the type of tub to be used, since it must be installed before the walls and windows go up. The color chosen for the tub will affect the rest of the color choices in the room.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If neutral colors are chosen for the large elements that form the background in the bath — walls, floor, fixtures — it’s easy to change the room’s looks, simply with accessories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accessories for the bath include candles, towel rings, plants, mirrors, robe hooks, glass shelves and more. Color can also be used as an accessory, with deeper colors being more traditional, while lighter colors have a more contemporary feel.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When choosing accessories, “Think of traditional accessories in un-traditional ways. Try placing a grouping of different accessories together on a wall — perhaps a towel bar, glass shelf and robe hook. The combination of the varying sizes and textures can add an interesting flavor to a room.”</p>

<p>Choices Abound</p>

<p>Until recently, chrome or polished brass were the only finish choices in the bath accessory marketplace. Fortunately, the industry has changed dramatically in the last decade, and manufacturers now offer dozens of finish and style options in bath accessories.</p>

<p>“The bath accessory marketplace has really come to life in the last few years,” added Jungbluth. “Consumers today have more choices than ever before. From ‘retro’ styles in oil-rubbed bronze to contemporary designs in brushed chrome � dramatic wrought iron finishes and even accessories made in maple and oak, homeowners have a wide variety of new and innovative design options for the bath.”</p>

<p>With all of the new options, Americans still hold true to a traditional finish. According to the aforementioned survey, chrome is still the most popular bath accessory finish, but consumers’ second choice, brushed nickel, is on the rise. In addition, other finishes, such as oil-rubbed bronze and wrought iron, are also increasing in popularity with consumers. In fact, non-chrome finishes now represent almost half of bath accessory sales.</p>

<p>Relying on this extensive research, Creative Specialties International recently introduced four new bath accessory collections designed to reflect the styles used in today’s bath. Sold under the Inspirations brand, the Kelsey, Vernini, Sienna and Westbury collections each fall into one of the three design categories — traditional, contemporary/casual or country.</p>

<p>Featuring a distinctive retro flair, the Kelsey collection offers a unique look that combines simple curved lines and soft details. Perfect for a bath with a casual style, its design features a round base with ceramic accents and curved posts.</p>

<p>For those looking for a bath accessory with contemporary style, the Vernini collection is the ideal choice. Drawing from a modern European look, it offers a crisp, decorative style for the bath. What sets this collection apart is its sophisticated, architectural elements including geometric-shaped posts and finials.</p>

<p>The Sienna collection brings a fresh, new look to wrought iron, making it more style-oriented and updated in appearance. With a dramatic black finish that highlights the collection’s handcrafted workmanship, it works in many design contexts to make a bold statement in the bathroom.</p>

<p>To enhance a country feel in the bath, the collection features the warm look of decorative wood. It brings classic bath accessory design elements to a wood collection offering a streamlined, clean appearance. Like fine furniture, it utilizes metal accents for an updated look and is designed to match today’s popular cabinetry finishes and is sized so it does not overwhelm the bath.</p>

<p>Final Thoughts</p>

<p>Congratulations! By this point, you should be completely comfortable with adding the finishing touches to your home through the world of accessories. You know what accessorizing is, how to select a style, and carry it through to the bath. The room has been well planned and includes your own personal stamp.</p>

<p>Whether you’re building a home or simply redecorating, we can all see the dramatic effect accessories can have in creating your home’s style. Remember to keep the style consistent, and have fun in trying new things.</p>

<p>The best advice? “Experiment and try different techniques,” added to “Decorating with accessories is a cost-effective way of changing the look of a room in a matter of minutes.”</p>

  </header>

    <p>If you drop a crackers, you hurt not only your enemies but your friends as well. This is the effect food additives have on humans.</p>

<p>Man has existed for thousands of years, and only started using additives at the start of the industrial revolution, when women were set free. Most animals eat their food when and where it is grown. Not humans. Man, because of his concentrated urban areas, was forced to ship and process his food.</p>

<p>Food additives are any substances added to food which may have some “useful” purpose, such as protection from deterioration or spoilage.</p>

<p>Additives are also used to improve taste, flavor, texture, and appearance to restore nutritive value and to aide in processing and packaging. There are at least 704 additives used in the processing of our food.</p>

<p>According to the Food and Drug Administration, manufacturers have to prove that the additives are necessary.</p>

<p>Additives kill bacteria of all living organisms in the food, so there is no decay. There is nothing to prevent them from harming body enzymes and organs.</p>

<p>Milk is a good example. Calcium chloride is added to canned and evaporated milk. It is also used to melt snow and causes metal parts to disintegrate. Milk substitutes contain an array of acids and gases.</p>

<p>Choose your bread carefully. It takes five times the chemicals to make whole wheat bread than white bread.</p>

<p>Sugar is pumped so full of acids, then boiled several times, which makes it the deadest and most dangerous product on the market. Meat has about 13 different additives, ranging from dyes to acids to buffers.</p>

<p>Then to find out what’s in your food-read labels and check with the FDA.</p>

    <p>Being an effective teacher one’s child begins first with knowing how you child learns. Getting a grasp on your child’s learning characteristics is essential to homeschooling success. What is your child’s learning ability levels? Motivation is also an important aspect. What motivates your child to learn? Knowing the pieces of your child’s learning style come together to make up the learning environment. A child’s learning activity is as diverse as each one’s personality. As you can see, a one size fits all approach isn’t going to be conducive to a dynamic learning environment.</p>

<p>In the beginning the best way to learn about how your child learns is to observe everything they do in their daily activities. Take notes, written or mental on how the child learns and approaches new learning situations. For instance, do they appear to learn more by touching and feeling, do they seem to learn more by drawing or expression? Do they learn by watching or doing? Today there are many child development tools, books, and software available on various types of learning styles to you to get you going in the right direction. Do some online searches regarding child learning, learning activities, child’s learning tools, child learning websites. That type of criteria. You’ll find much information on all types of learning.</p>

<p>An often little thought of aspect to child’s learning is what time of day does the child learn best. When is their peak learning times? This is particularly more in play with younger children.</p>

<p>Again all of this discussion and now research that you have done is circling back to creating an optimal learning environment for you and your child. Knowing how they learn. What motivates children to learn? When do they learn best? All of these come under the heading of learning style. It’s important to know how to break the areas down into specific knowledge for yourself to insure that you create that highly effective learning environment so the learning experience for both you and your child is a wonderful road filled with much joy and discovery!</p>

  </header>

    <p>Rainy days can be so boring for a child and just as hard on moms. So we give some ideas to brighten your day and chase their rainy day blues away!</p>

<p>Shadow puppets</p>

<p>In a room that is fairly dark set up a flash light so it is facing a wall. Have the children make hand shadows If they get really good at them they could even put on a little play.</p>

<p>My box home</p>

<p>As a little girl some of my best times were spent making Barbie homes out of medium card board boxes. Paints, markers, crayons, fabric scraps, glue, and so on were used to fashion wall paper curtains and the like. The ideas and possibilities are endless!</p>

<p>Little boys can make garages for there cars as well.</p>

<p>Magazine Story</p>

<p>Take ten pieces of paper. Staple them together. Have you child go threw a magazine and pick out 10 pictures to cut out. Tell him/her to paste one on each page. Now what ever order they are in the must right a story, the story should have some thing to do with the pictures on each page. This can be a real challenge but is endless fun and giggles.</p>

<p>Puzzles</p>

<p>Have you child search for a few pictures they like in an old magazine. Paste these pictures onto heavy cardboard. With a paint brush, brush on a coat of clear drying glue that completely dry. Once they are dry cut them up into different shaped pieces. Now you have a puzzle for this rainy day and rainy days to come! Store in zip lock bags.</p>

<p>Bean Bag Pals</p>

<p>You will need a 10×10 square of felt, thread, needle, a parent to sew, beans or rice, tacky glue and scraps of different color felts to decorate with. Mom or Dad should sew the squares together all the way around, all but about 2 inches. Turn the square inside right. Fill with the beans or rice and sew closed. It can be decorated with the scarps of felt to make animals. Googly eyes are fun to add as well but are not recommended for children under four.</p>

<p>A Gift of Comfort.</p>

<p>Not long ago when I was in the hospital having my son, I was given a special heat pack for my back. It was very simple and would be a great project for children to help with. My suggestion is have your child make about 30 and donate then to a labor and delivery floor.</p>

<p>Rice Sock Heat Packs</p>

<p>You will need white men’s tube socks ones that have no preformed heal medium is a good size.</p>

<p>You will need uncooked white rice (not minute)</p>

<p>You will need ribbon any color or colors you like.</p>

<p>Gift tags that tie on.</p>

<p>Fill each sock two inches from the top.</p>

<p>Tie a length of ribbon tightly in a knot attach the gift card and then make a bow.</p>

<p>On the gift tag write the instructions for use (you could make gift tags on your computer and print them all out) Microwave on high for 2 minutes or until it reaches the desired warmth. Enjoy!</p>

<p>These work great, stay warm for a long time. If your child makes them to give away it is an added bonus of pride!</p>

<p>Dress Up</p>

<p>My children have a tote full of dress up clothing. I did it inexpensively threw yard sales, Dollar Stores, Halloween clearances and Good Will. I pick up things such as jewelry, hats, sun glasses, badges, fancy dresses, costumes and other articles of interest. Many times I save new things to add on a rainy day or another day they have nothing to do. It generates new interest and hours of play. One reader even mentioned the idea of theme boxes. Such as a fairy box if that was what your little girl was into or a princess or a firemen etc. I think that is a good idea for but also I believe a good mix of things inspires imagination and creativity.</p>

<p>Driving Mat</p>

<p>A huge poster board or cardboard is great to let your little one paint roads on for his cars In fact I bought my sons a light colors rug remnant (it was cheap) about 4×5 .It can be any size you like. My sons used fabric paints on the rug. They painted lakes, roads, airports trees and so on. If you decided to do the poster board you can use crayons or markers as well. They had a really great time making this one rainy day and still enjoy it to this day. When they are done they just roll it up and put it away. Card board milk cartons can be saved and painted to make little decorative houses and stores as well as stores to place on their car mat. Be sure to wash them well, dry them and staple them closed.</p>
