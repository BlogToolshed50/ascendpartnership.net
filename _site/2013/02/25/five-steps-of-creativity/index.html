    <p>Why is it that when one mentions the word creativity most people deny that they possess such a trait? Is it because many believe that creativity refers to a person who possesses talent and expresses it in some artistic manner?</p>

<p>You do NOT have to be an artist to be creative. You can express your creativity in any area of life. Creative energy is available to all of us and it does not matter what work you engage in. Creativity is connecting to your soul, the very essence of your being.</p>

<p>“Creative expression lies in all of us and requires a sense of trust and the freedom to allow the flowing for the magic to happen.”</p>

<p>You might be saying, “Joanne, that is easy for you to say being an artist, but I have no creative bone in my body!”</p>

<p>To which I say, “Let’s explore that thought some more.”</p>

<p>Take a serious look at your life up to this point in time. Honestly look at the times when you have experienced and felt joy. What was it you were doing? Now, follow the thread back to its origin the place where this experience of joy was but a fleeting thought or inspiration coming from YOU. Can you see how your actions and the journey that transpired brought you to a deeper connection with your soul?</p>

<p>This connection to your soul, the very essence of your being, is creativity. You express yourself creatively every time you tap into your soul energy. Each time you do this you feel the joy of your willingness, and the more you feel this joy the more you are in tune with the Universe and the Laws of Attraction. You have begun the creative process.</p>

<p>Once started, the flowing of those creative juices continues to enhance your life and you carry the vitality of this energy with you at all times. By staying open to life and its gifts along the way, the next time a fleeting thought or inspiration surfaces you again take action for your creative juices are activated and flowing. You are connected with your soul. You are connected with your creativity.</p>

<p>FIVE STEPS OF CREATIVITY</p>

<p>STEP ONE: Start where you are and accept that you are creative. Trust that this is a journey which will unfold as it is meant to and do NOT rush the process. Be kind to yourself and most of all do not judge, criticize, or compare yourself with others. You are unique. Always honor yourself and your instincts.</p>

<p>STEP TWO: Open yourself to new experiences. Allow that freshness to bathe your soul and awaken areas within you that have been quiet or dormant. There are lessons waiting to be discovered so remain coach-able and teachable. Remember, when the student is ready the teacher will appear.</p>

<p>STEP THREE: Increase your attitude of gratitude and be open to synchronistic events. The higher the vibrational energy you project, the greater your alignment with the Universe and the wealth of your creative journey. Detach yourself from the outcome and trust in the process. Create for the sake of creation and remain in that state.</p>

<p>STEP FOUR: As your creativity brings results, always remain humble for this state will insure that more will follow. Be open to receiving and know that praise and compliments are for the higher Self and not for the ego. Make modifications along the journey as your instinct desires.</p>

<p>STEP FIVE: Always start creative journeys based on service and for the highest good of all. Those who base their creativity on service to others find that emotional vitality is what inspires their creativity. Be sure to give your creativity a place of honor and you may find that even the most mundane tasks turn into creative projects.</p>

<p>MAY YOUR LIFE BE FILLED WITH CREATIVE EXPRESSION</p>
