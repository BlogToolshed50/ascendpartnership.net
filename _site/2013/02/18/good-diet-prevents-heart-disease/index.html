    <p>By the years passing medicine discovers many solutions for diseases in our food. Eating diet is considered as one of the main factors of heart disease. If people eat healthy diet, they shall cut a long way to prevent heart disease. However, there are some foods can resolve heart disease problems. This article is noting the advantages of chili and yogurt to control cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>A new study done by U.S researches and was published in the Journal of Food Biochemistry suggested that type two diabetes and high blood pressure could be controlled by eating soy yogurt, and it is better if it included fruit. The study found that soy yogurt and some dairy yogurts may control some enzymes which influence blood sugar levels.</p>

<p>The results found that soy blueberry yogurt powerfully affected three enzymes: angiotensin, alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase. Peach and strawberry yogurt also affected alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase. Researches also found that Plain soy yogurt is the strongest, followed by blueberry dairy yogurt on phenol and antioxidant content. They also found that Soy yogurt is also the best at inhibiting ACE, which causes blood vessels to narrow and raises blood pressure.</p>

<p>Have you ever had a look at heart disease rates among some countries? Around 8 percent of people in America suffer heart disease, however, in India the rates is less than one percent. Scientists referred chili as one of the factors which help decrease the danger of developing heart disease. Indian food is famous with it hot favor, and Indian use chili just like salt in their food (eating too much may cause some side effects).</p>

<p>Chili has so many medical benefits, it starts from influenza to obstinate diseases. Researches found that Cayenne and other red chili peppers can lower cholesterol levels platelet aggregation and triglyceride. It also increases the body’s ability to dissolve fibrin (an important substance to the configuration of blood clots).</p>

<p>Have you seen an obese Indian? For me I have never seen an obese Indian, even rich ones. Chili helps reduces weight. The heat you feel when you eat chili is converted from your body, by burning more calories. In this way chili prevent obesity which is one of the main causes of heart disease.</p>

<p>Beside the advantages of yogurt and chili there are disadvantages of eating too much of them. Just like any food if you eat too much it converts to a cause of a disease. Therefore you must ask your doctor to suggest for you a good and healthy diet to follow.</p>

<p>In conclusion, body’s health in general is a reflection to the person’s diet. If you eat a healthy diet you will have a healthy heart and body, yet you must do some exercises at least two times a weak.</p>
