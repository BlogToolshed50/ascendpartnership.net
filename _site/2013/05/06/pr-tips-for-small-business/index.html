    <p>Attracting new customers who will buy your products and services is one of the most important goals of a business – more so for a start up business. There are many different methods that you can use to entice customers and attract their attention. But one of the best ways of doing this is to use tried and tested public relations skills. PR can give some excellent results for your online company formation with the added benefit of using very little financial resources.</p>

<p>Public relations (PR) is, quite simply, the relationship your business has with the public. The kind of relationship you will establish with your public is bound to have a significant effect on the future of your business. This is where public relations can help. PR is when you publicize and build interest and enthusiasm for your business among your public. Successfully doing this would create more awareness for your business and its products and services as well as driving sales.</p>

<p>Following are tips that would help you make effective PR efforts</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Before you start planning any PR efforts make sure that your product or service is ready. Ensure that your product is primed for public consumption. Bring it out, make sure it works and that it does something that people will care about. Because PR drives customer demand, you will miss out on important sales or even drive your customers away and to your competitors if they do come to you and your products are not ready.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must get to know your market. A successful PR thrust is based on reaching the right audience with a message that is appropriate and meaningful to them. If you are not familiar with your target audience as well as the publications that they read, chances are, implementing the rest of your PR actions will be completely useless. There would be no point of trying to get your story printed in a financial paper when your audience primarily reads the regular dailies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should learn all about the media to more effectively target your efforts. When you define your audience you will also have to know their reading habits (what publications do they read), the radio programs that they listen to, the TV programs that they watch as well as the websites that they visit. Take the time to familiarize yourself with the media outlets that you plan to target. You will need to get a good idea of that type of stories that you will need to present to optimize your chance of coverage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most integral part of your PR campaign is your message so make sure that it is clear, concise and brief. If you cannot sum up your message in a few sentences then it is too complicated and editors won’t probably read it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
