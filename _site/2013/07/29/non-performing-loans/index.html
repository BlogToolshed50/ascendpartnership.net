    <p>In the recent days we come across a lot of news on the bad debts in the banking industry that is normally called as the Non Performing Loans. When the economy is not assisting the growth of the business, the failure to repay the loan availed is on the increase. Many defaults that are happening in the agriculture sector is due to failure of the crop and the UN remunerative price offered to the agriculturists.</p>

<p>As a whole the banking industry in various countries suffer due to this issue and there are instances that the banks file bankruptcy due to the negative net worth. Though the banks are meticulously follow the systems to deliver the loans there are occasions that they fail in their judgment and the loan becomes bad.</p>

<p>The banks devise various methods to recover the loan once it becomes non performing as they have to suffer loss. The banks resort to the legal means also at times to recover the dues from the intentional defaulters who are having sufficient means to repay the loan. Despite all the positive efforts, they have to face the issue of non performing assets in their portfolio due to govt policies as well.</p>

<p>It is high time that stringent norms are put in place while extending the loan to the borrowers and timely recovery is made. If you observe the recent set back in the USA, many banks were closed putting the taxpayers money at stake. As an individual one must prove to be a responsible citizen to maintain the health of the banking system by prompt repayment.</p>
