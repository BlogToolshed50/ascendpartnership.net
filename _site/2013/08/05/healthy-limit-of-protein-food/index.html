    <p>As we all aware of, the body is in need of protein food to repair and build the body muscle., but scientists caution that excessive protein food can build up the ketones and drive the kidneys to overwork to flush them out, which is not good for health. As a result of too much consumption of protein food, one can lose significant amount of water from the body leading to the weakness and dizziness. One may undergo loss of hair, low appetite and even breath due to the excessive intake of the protein rich food. The kidney gets strained due to overwork to combat the ill effect of taking more protein food than what are needed.</p>

<p>If any one is fond of crossing the limit of protein foods, they are bounds to add more fat in the system since the excess protein is converted to fat by the system in the words of Dr. Tickoo, consultant in international medicine, the body converts the protein’s nitrogen in to uric acid which in large quantity affects the kidney and results in the formation of kidney stones. The body is capable of processing about four to five grams of protein per hour. If you are taking a protein shake and bar it may take about 10 hours to digest and absorb. Such instant shakes also makes you miss the vitamins and nutrients one is able to get from the real food. Too much protein can also lead to the risk of getting haemorrhoid, polyps and colon cancer. An amount of 50 to 70 gm of protein is found to be sufficient per day to maintain the health.</p>
