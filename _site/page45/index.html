  </header>

    <p>Guest post written by Charlotte Brown</p>

<p>I started watching the show I Love Lucy when I was a little girl so I wasn’t really surprised when my daughter started to love the show too because I still watch it all the time when it comes on TV, which is a couple of times a day. So when I asked her what she wanted to dress up as for Halloween, she told me that she wanted to be Lucy.</p>

<p>I think the idea is so cute, I wish I had thought of dressing up as Lucy back when I was a little girl, that I started looking for stuff for her to wear right away. During my search for a red wig for her to wear, I saw some deals on satellite internet service and decided to click here and switch over to a new provider.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, most Lucy style hair wigs are for adults, not kids. So I bought an adult Lucy wig trimming it down so that it will fit on my daughter’s head. She talked one of the little neighbor boys that she pals aroudn with to dress up as Ricky so I’m going to find him a bongo set to carry around too.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Compared to cash contracts, which require payment against the physical delivery of goods immediately or after a specified period, a futures contract is a special type of agreement made strictly under the rules of a commodity exchange, which may or may not call for the actual delivery of goods and payment in cash on a future date.</p>

<p>According to Emery, a futures contract can be defined as a contract for the future delivery of some commodity without reference to specific lots, made under the rules of some commercial body, in a set form, by which the conditions as to unit of amount, the quality and time of delivery are stereotyped, and only the determination of the total amounts and the price is left open to the contracting parties.</p>

<p>Such contracts are meant exclusively for future settlement, though the exact date of the settlement is decided by reference to the wishes of the seller and the established rules of the commodity exchange. Such contracts do not specify the particular grade of a commodity, but impliedly refer to a basic grade called the contract grade, accepted as the common grade for all futures dealings. The details in respect to the amount, the time of settlement, the quality and so forth are mentioned in the rules and regulations, and are common to all such contracts. The contracting parties have to decide upon the price at which the contract is to be settled, sometime in one of the trading months specified by the exchange.</p>

<p>Futures contracts are made only in the ‘ring’ of the commodity exchanges, and not outside the exchanges. Only members of a commodity exchange can enter into such a deal. No outsider can become a party to a futures agreement. Such contracts can be made only in multiples of a fixed unit of trading. No such contracts can be made in fractions of these units.</p>
