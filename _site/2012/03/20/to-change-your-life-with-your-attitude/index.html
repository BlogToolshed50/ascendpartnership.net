    <p>Life is good. When you think with a positive attitude your whole demeanor changes. While looking at life as a negative, negative things will follow you. Test it out. I’d rather you tested out thinking positive about every day things and watch your life improve. Your entire feeling of well-being will improve.</p>

<p>For example, if you are waiting in line and sick of standing there, try to think of others that wish they had the money to buy the items you are purchasing. Be grateful you have the money and job to live your life in a more comfortable way. Or perhaps think of the ill person stuck in bed. I am sure they would love to be standing in line instead of feeling awful.</p>

<p>Instead of complaining you have to get up early to go to work be happy you have a job. To help you wake up easier have a glass of water by your bed. By drinking the water right away it will wake you up. Also, the night before post a note on your alarm clock. The note should say something like “I am a wonderful giving person.” You can write anything positive to your character. And lastly, think of one fun thing you get to do that day. For instance, I am going to lunch with my co-workers and we will share a lot of laughs. It can be anything simple to complicated.</p>

<p>By turning your life around you will be an inspiration to others. They will think of you when they think of good and happy things. You will truly be inspirational to people and they will feed off of your positive attitude. This is one way to make the entire world better. By you changing your attitude, you will be changing others outlook on life one person at a time. Think how elated you will feel knowing you have helped others by helping yourself.</p>

<p>If you look at things with an appreciative attitude your life will change. Yes your life will change as well as others, indeed for the better. You are an inspirational person.</p>
