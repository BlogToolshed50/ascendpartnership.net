    <p>Make Your Own Holiday Day. Choose one of the most flexible holidays. You can celebrate this day for any reason you wish. It is for you. Make a day to celebrate a day you have forgotten, or invent one for your fun. There is no compulsion and no common theme for the day. This day is for each of us to enjoy a holiday. I have not been able to find out how this tradition originated.</p>

<p>But is a great idea. Make a holiday today, if it is 26th March. Why not to expand the idea little further and begin celebrating many more days for no rhyme or reason but to enjoy and have fun? All right, we need not take a holiday from work on all such days, but can try to create a holiday-like atmosphere. Can this not be done? Let me elaborate. For example, I make 7th of every month a special day for myself. I work on that day, but try to bring in as much fun as possible. Throw parties, go walking, take life little less seriously and try to fill the day with as much joy as possible. I hope that I am making myself clear.</p>

<p>All of us have conditioned our minds. We will celebrate each holiday on a particular day and follow the particular tradition for that. Why? Why not to be little more inventive and create our own holidays along with other traditional ones? Imagine 12 more days a year full of fun and joy. Let me give another example. Say, I was born on the 10th July. Generally, I will celebrate my birthday on that day every year. Why cannot I call every 10th my birthday and have fun? No, I am not asking for presents for twelve birthdays, but at least nothing can stop me from treating friends? Nothing can stop me from enjoying the 10th of every month as my birthday and carry that cheer in my heart? I am not asking my friends to send me cards, but won’t they be happy to get from me saying thank you? or to say a Hello? Or wish Good Morning?</p>

<p>Only our attitude stops us from making a day cheerful for our friends and ourselves. This special day reminds us of the immense possibilities of human imagination to make our life a beautiful life. Best, let us make everyday a holiday. Let everyday be a holiday from worries and stress. Give tension a holiday everyday. Give a very long and permanent holiday to all those emotions such as jealousy, worry, stress, tension, and their friends.</p>
