    <p>Change management is a process in the IT field that often involves a major transition of an organization or entity, from one state to another. These changes are not restricted to the organization alone; they also involve the individual employees and teams of the organization. Before embarking upon any change it is necessary to realize why the change is done, and what needs to be achieved because of it. This transition is done after some thoughtful planning and with careful implementation. The aim of change management is to efficiently make the necessary changes in the company, without having any adverse effects or consequences. As there are very few working environments that can actually ignore change, you can easily guess its importance. Change management helps in ensuring standardized methods and processes used for all changes, and forecasting and handling all problems that might arise with changes. Most of the problems arise when change is forced upon people; it needs to be realistic, over a period of time and achievable.</p>

<p>When any kind of change is being planned, these essential elements need to be remembered:</p>

<p>1.The psychology of change differs from individual to individual.</p>

<p>2.Everyone’s needs differ and have to be met.</p>

<p>3.With change comes a chance of loss.</p>

<p>4.No individual or organization can ignore change.</p>

<p>Change Management Purpose:</p>

<p>The main reason behind enforcing such a plan in your organization is to make sure the negative impact of the change is minimized. A change maybe optional or mandatory, for example to adhere to governmental policies is mandatory and needs to be followed by one and all. The purpose is to basically change the scope, schedule and other aspects of a particular project.</p>

<p>Change Management Process:</p>

<p>Organization change has been a rapid process over the past few decades, with technology and the Internet turning this world into a small place, you will find that there is faster and easier access to knowledge. Thus, change has become part of our lives. The change management process is a series of steps that a change management team would follow for the application of change management. There will be many times where organizations and individuals will encounter changing conditions, that they are powerless to control. This is why change is crucial and change management is essential. The faster and more efficient you are towards change, the more you will benefit. There are many plans and strategies one can follow to implement effective change in the organization. The process involves several sequences of steps that will help to control, track and manage change. One can record change requests, and review and approve those requests, before final implementation. It is also easy to monitor the real impact of these changes, which will make the future decisions of change management (if any) easier. Whichever strategy or plan is followed, one must keep in mind that communication is the essential key to effective change management, starting right from the top to the lowest.</p>

<p>A good change management process should adhere to the following:</p>

<p>1.Explores the feasibility of all the steps.</p>

<p>2.Explain in detail all the steps of the process.</p>

<p>3.Clearly explains the responsibility of each manager or project leader.</p>

<p>4.Describes the change review and approval process.</p>

<p>5.Systematically keep track of all the ideas implemented and their results.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why this kind of change management processes fails, one of the main reasons is lack of understanding by the management themselves. There are several stages or phases the organization or individual employees go through as soon as the process is started. They are:</p>

<p>1.Shock</p>

<p>2.Denial</p>

<p>3.Understanding</p>

<p>4.Acceptance</p>

<p>5.Learning</p>

<p>6.Implementing</p>

<p>The main reasons for failure of the process are:</p>

<p>1.Lack of top level commitment</p>

<p>2.Lack of vision and forecasting</p>

<p>3.Lack of clarity and communication</p>

<p>4.Ineffective implementation</p>

<p>5.Resistance to change by individuals</p>
