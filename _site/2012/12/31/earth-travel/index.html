    <p>Earth has three motions. It spin like a top approximately an imaginary line called an axis that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole, it travels approximately the sun, and it moves through the Milky Way along with the sun and the take it easy of the solar system.</p>

<p>Earth takes 24 hours to spin completely around on its partnership so that the sun is in the same place in the sky. This stage is called a solar day. During a solar day, Earth moves a petite around its orbit so that it faces the stars a little another way each night. Thus, it only takes 23 hours 56 minutes 4.09 second for Earth to spin once so that the stars show to be in the same place in the sky. This phase is called a sidereal day. A sidereal day is shorter than an astrophysical day, so the stars appear to rise about 4 action earlier each day.</p>

<p>Earth takes 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes 9.54 seconds to sphere the sun. This measurement lengthwise of time is called a sidereal year. Because Earth does not spin a whole number of times as it goes just about the sun, the almanac gets out of step with the seasons by about 6 hours each year. Every four years, a day is added to bring the chart back into line with the seasons. These years, called leap years, have 366 days. The extra day is new to the end of February and occurs as February 29.</p>

<p>The distance in the order of Earth’s orbit is 584 million miles. Earth travels in its range at 66,700 miles (107,000 kilometers) an hour, or 18.5 miles (30 kilometers) a second. Earth’s path lies on an imaginary flat surface about the sun called the orbital plane.</p>

<p>Earth’s axis is not directly up and down, but is slanted by about 23 1/2 degrees compared to the orbital plane. This tilt and Earth’s motion just about the sun causes the change of the seasons. In January, the northern half of Earth tilts left from the sun. Sunlight is reach thinly over the northern half of Earth, and the north experiences winter. At the same time, the daylight falls extremely on the southern half of Earth, which has summer. By July, Earth has moved to the opposite side of the sun. Now the northern half of Earth tilts toward the sun. Sunlight falls intensely over the northern half of Earth, and the north experiences summer. At the same time, the sunlight falls less intensely on the southern half of Earth, which has winter.</p>

<p>Earth’s orbit is not a perfect circle. Earth is somewhat closer to the sun in early January (winter in the Northern Hemisphere) and out of away in July. In January, Earth is 91.4 million miles (147.1 million kilometers) from the sun, and in July it is 94.5 million miles (152.1 million kilometers) from the sun. This variation has a far smaller effect than the heating and cooling caused by the tilt of Earth’s axis.</p>

<p>Earth and the solar system are part of a vast disk of stars called the Milky Way Galaxy. Just as the moon orbits Earth and planets orbit the sun, the sun and other star orbit the tightly packed center of the Milky Way. The solar organization is about two-fifths of the way from the center of the Milky Way and revolves about the center at regarding 155 miles (249 kilometers) per second. The solar organization makes one whole revolution around the hub of the galaxy in regarding 220 million years.</p>

<p>In some areas, the field is thousands of times stronger than the overall compelling field. In these places, clusters of field lines break from first to last the shell, creating loops in the solar mood. At one end of the loop, the breakthrough point is a magnetic north pole. At this point, the direction of the field lines is rising — that is, away from the core. At the further end of the loop, the breakthrough point is a magnetic south pole, and the lines point downward. A sunspot forms at each point. The field lines guide ions and electrons into the breathing space above the sunspots, producing huge loops of gas.</p>

<p>The number of sunspots on the sun depends on the quantity of distortion in the field. The change in this number, from a minimum to a maximum and back to a least amount, is identified as the sunspot cycle. The average age of the sunspot cycle is about 11 years.</p>

<p>At the end of a sunspot cycle, the compelling fields quickly reverse its polarity and lose most of its buckle. Suppose the sun’s compelling North Pole and its geographic north pole were at the same place at the sound of a given cycle. At the commencement of the next cycle, the magnetic north pole would be at the same rest as the geographic South Pole. A vary of polarity from one direction to the other and reverse again equals the periods of two succeeding sunspot cycle and is therefore about 22 years.</p>
