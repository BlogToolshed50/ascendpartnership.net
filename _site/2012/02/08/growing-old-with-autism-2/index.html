    <p>For many people adult autism is just the way of life. They have to endure living with this disorder, which can be very difficult because they can’t function as normal people can function. For some people, they have learned to accept this disorder and live with it, but what makes it really difficult for some, is how those around them treat them and by society in general. As a society, we should try our best to study and learn and understand what adult autism is and not just for those who were diagnosed with this disorder. By learning as much as we can as a society, we can better help those who have to live with this disorder for which there is no known cure for. After all, these are people too, just like the rest of us and are just as important as everyone else’s.</p>

<p>This Disorder is Not a Curse</p>

<p>There many people who do not see adult autism as a curse. In fact, there are many people who actually enjoy being autistic. They considered being autistic a part of who they are and wouldn’t have it any other way. They don’t want to be cured; they just want to be accepted by everyone. Yes, they too have strengths and weaknesses like everyone else, but most of all, they are people and have every right to enjoy life just like you and me.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, autism starts in infancy. What this means is that this person has been living with this disorder for some time now. Autistic adults see the world differently from others. Their five senses work normally, however their brains just process the information differently. The way information is processed and stored and interpreted are slightly different from that of a normal person. Some experts believe that this may cause some of the more detrimental effects of autism, such as fits and tantrums. Reacting to the world normally would be extremely difficult for someone that already has a lot of stress and anxiety.</p>
