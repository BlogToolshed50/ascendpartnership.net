    <p>The recent article on the intake of sugar foods by the teens must be an eye opener for those who go for more sugar in the younger ages. Study reveals that the consumption of the high sugar foods by the teenagers lead to the increased risk of heart related diseases. These high sugar diets are found to contain poor cholesterol and the triglyceride profiles which easily makes them prone to the heart diseases in the latter part of the life.</p>

<p>The problem gets more aggravated in the case of teens with obesity who take added sugar in their foods. This also increases the sign of insulin resistance. It is better that we give timely advice to the children to start the process of taking the needed amount of sugar foods to void becoming a prey to the heart related diseases and the insulin resistance.</p>

    <p>As a self-proclaimed skeptic looking for a REAL way to make honest $ on the internet, it took a long time to find something I felt was worth investigating. I have checked out many sites, trying to compare potential with time and $ required to make them work. All I wanted was something where within a few days I saw results and the more I put in, the more I got out.</p>

<p>There is money to be made on the internet if you know how, the problem is finding a proven way that anyone can follow. Most of the sites I checked out claimed to teach you how, but charge large amounts and deliver only vague information that did not help me. Finally found a system that delivered real results for me.</p>

<p>When I found Mark Warren’s Ultimate Wealth Package, I started out trying to poke holes in the system to prove it did not work, but could not find any holes in it. Even found several independent research sites that had compared his system to many others, basically confirming my findings.</p>

<p>The most recent research site compares 3 systems proven to work, listing unbiased strengths and weaknesses of each. I encourage you to look at this comparison if you are considering the Internet as an income source.</p>

  </header>

    <p>The fact you are reading this probably indicates you have concerns about the rate of your hair loss. Baldness may sometimes be a source of amusement to those with a full head of hair, but premature hair loss at any age can be the cause of intense concern to those affected.</p>

<p>But you can do something about this! By following the guidelines suggested in this article you will place yourself in a position to identify a hair loss treatment that not only works but also fits in with your lifestyle and preferences.</p>

<p>To achieve this you must truthfully answer four simple questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the true cause of your hair loss?</li>
</ol>

<p>Most instances of hair loss in men, for example, can be attributed to androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness) but you must be certain as this will influence your choice of hair loss treatment. To be completely certain you should consult with your physician.</p>

<ol>
  <li>How far has your hair loss progressed?</li>
</ol>

<p>It is crucial to realize that the sooner you start treating hair loss, the greater your chances of success. You need to identify the pattern of hair loss as this will help establish both the cause and most effective treatment option.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What hair loss treatment options are you prepared to consider?</li>
</ol>

<p>Your answer to this question will depend on a number of factors including the type and extent of hair loss, what treatments have been tried previously, your personal preferences with regard to using medications or natural remedies and the amount you are prepared to spend.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do you have sufficient patience and determination to succeed?</li>
</ol>

<p>There really are no miracle cures for premature hair loss. Equally, there are treatments that can halt and even reverse this condition, but none of them will work overnight. Treatments take time to work and there is no such thing as a remedy that suits everyone.</p>

<p>When you have given proper consideration to these questions you will find yourself in a better position to choose the hair loss treatment that best suits your circumstances. It you’re still not sure, talk to your physician or carry out more research. But you need to be clear on one point – the longer you delay, the more difficult your path to hair regrowth will be.</p>

  </header>

    <p>These days there’s a mad rush to be purpose driven and I wholeheartly agree, it is better to be purpose driven than going in reverse or stuck in neutral. However, why would I be content to be just purpose driven and not living my life’s purpose on purpose? I believe the real reason most people are okay with being just purpose driven is because they don’t know how to identify their real purpose for existing or what purpose means when it relates to individuals. If you’re reading this article, this is the day that was created for you to begin living your life with a purpose on purpose.</p>

<p>The (buzz) word purpose can be substituted for a number of words, some of which could be reason, intention, intent, use, idea, objective, aim, function or determination. In my opinion, a purpose is the reason why you exist to fulfill a specific task that only you can fulfill at a specific time and season here on the earth. A purpose should not, but often times are confused with a person’s call. Purpose and call are different. A call is a particular business, occupation, profession or trade. Once again, purpose is your intended reason for being. Most people live out their lives fulfilling their call, not their purpose. They have prepared themselves for a chosen field or profession. Since they do not know their purpose, they work in that field unhappy for many years and retire. They never venture out to find out what makes them happy. I’ve finally mentioned the operative word—happy, not just purpose!</p>

  </header>

    <p>As a business owner, I put these two key principles to work in training my employees. From the first day on the job, I work with them to be aware of what tasks are needed, what I expect of them, how I want customers treated, etc. And I ask them to master tasks and customer scripts. Once they are mastered, I open it up just like with my players. When correction is needed, it is usually in one of these two areas. They are either unaware of what is needed or they haven’t mastered the task at hand.</p>

<p>Not only does following these two concepts make it easy for me to get results with my players and employees, it also brings incredible results. My first team lost only one game all season and my employees rarely lose a sale. My businesses and products win awards earned by my employees. And, as a bonus, everyone enjoys themselves with this simple structure. I knew I was doing it right when the father of one of my boys told me that his boy enjoyed practice so much that he chose to come to practice instead of going to see our professional basketball team play one night. And I know it works with my employees because they show up on time happy, focused and ready to work. Remember, awareness and mastery are two essential keys to a successful small business.</p>

    <ul>
  <li>
    <p>Notify your immediate family of your departure and return dates, but don’t otherwise publicize your travel or vacation plans. Always leave contact information with your family. Provide them with an itinerary, hotel names, phone numbers, airline flight info, and any other important travel information. It is a good idea to also leave them a copy of your passport.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Register your trip with the state department online or with your embassy upon arrival.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check plane, train, and bus times before you travel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sit near other people or near aisles or doors. Learn the location of emergency alarms and exits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stay awake and alert when using public transportation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider purchasing special clothing or accessories to hide your passport, money, or credit cards. Keep the majority of your funds in traveler’s checks and hidden; carry some in your wallet or handbag. Use a money clip. If you are robbed, you may lose the money in the clip but will retain important credit cards and documents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep valuables out of sight and luggage close at hand. If carrying a handbag, keep it in front of you, closed, with the fastening toward your body. Keep a wallet in your front pants pocket.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let go if your bag is snatched.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do some research on the area you are visiting. Talk to your security officer or consular colleagues regarding travel advisories or warnings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When traveling, dress casually; dress down where appropriate. Be aware of local customs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t wear excess jewelry. Reduce wallet and purse contents, particularly cards that denote affiliations, memberships, accounts, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At airports, proceed through security checks and go to the boarding area as quickly as possible. These areas are usually the most secure in the airport.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any crowded situation, be aware of any crowding or jostling, even if it appears innocent. This is often a ploy by pickpockets to distract you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be very careful any time you use a telephone calling card. Fraudulent uses of these cards are on the rise. Look for people observing your card or your fingers as you dial your code. Avoid being heard giving the number to local telephone operators.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maintain a low profile, use common sense, know your surroundings, and have a safe trip. Don’t bring attention to yourself with your clothing or your actions. Be alert, report anything suspicious, and obey security personnel.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We live in dangerous times and have to remain ever vigilant. You never know when something bad may happen to you or your family. Follow the above tips to minimize your risk and increase the odds of you having an incident</p>

    <p>By opening up your minds to new possibilities, you may find that you are being led by that glorious, higher self within us to explore possibilities that have the potential to bring us peace, joy, wealth, success — all good things.</p>

<p>If someone tells you that you shouldn’t do something because it doesn’t work, what that person is really saying is that it doesn’t work for him. Listen to your heart, gather all the information and let the Universe show you how to make it work.</p>

<p>Listens a lot more that reflects and thinks about what you hears, sees or reads. You are willing to listen to points of view that are totally different from your own without getting defensive as he used to. As a result, he has become more tolerant, more compassionate and, in many ways, more successful. He has grown into a fantastic young man who, I am sure, will bring much credit to all that you chooses to do.</p>

<p>Let us not be like the person in the little ditty who says:</p>

<p>“In matters controversial, my perception’s really fine. I always see both points of view — the one that’s wrong and mine.”</p>

<p>Let us, instead, listen to all that comes to our notice and after reflecting on it, exhibit the qualities of tolerance, peace, understanding and compassion. And as Commander Spock would say, “Live long and prosper.”</p>

  </header>

    <p>Here are some examples of food that should be eaten after a workout.</p>

<p>Eating bread has been known to replenish the energy lost after a workout. Since this has certain ingredients that are high in bad cholesterol, this can be substituted for wheat bread that is much healthier. Nuts can also help lower the cholesterol and getting some low fat peanut butter will surely make a great sandwich.</p>

<p>Having a fruit is also good to lower the cholesterol. It is advisable to eat as a whole instead of taking away the skin or turning this into a juice. Studies have shown that eating it the way it is keeps the natural fibers that are good for the person. An apple is just one of many fruits that can be eaten once it has been washed.</p>

<p>If the person wants to save some money after going to the gym, it is best to pack some snacks that can be consumed after a workout. Cutting some carrot sticks or slicing a few tomatoes then packing it in a plastic container will come in handy after taking a shower and reporting for work or when going home.</p>

<p>When the person comes home, it is time to prepare something that can provide better sustenance. An example could be having some fish or chicken thrown into the microwave or having it steam. Studies have shown that frying using cooking oil also increases the person’s cholesterol level so cooking it in another manner can reduce this.</p>
