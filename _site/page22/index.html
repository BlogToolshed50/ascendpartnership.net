  </header>

    <p>Life is good. When you think with a positive attitude your whole demeanor changes. While looking at life as a negative, negative things will follow you. Test it out. I’d rather you tested out thinking positive about every day things and watch your life improve. Your entire feeling of well-being will improve.</p>

<p>For example, if you are waiting in line and sick of standing there, try to think of others that wish they had the money to buy the items you are purchasing. Be grateful you have the money and job to live your life in a more comfortable way. Or perhaps think of the ill person stuck in bed. I am sure they would love to be standing in line instead of feeling awful.</p>

<p>Instead of complaining you have to get up early to go to work be happy you have a job. To help you wake up easier have a glass of water by your bed. By drinking the water right away it will wake you up. Also, the night before post a note on your alarm clock. The note should say something like “I am a wonderful giving person.” You can write anything positive to your character. And lastly, think of one fun thing you get to do that day. For instance, I am going to lunch with my co-workers and we will share a lot of laughs. It can be anything simple to complicated.</p>

<p>By turning your life around you will be an inspiration to others. They will think of you when they think of good and happy things. You will truly be inspirational to people and they will feed off of your positive attitude. This is one way to make the entire world better. By you changing your attitude, you will be changing others outlook on life one person at a time. Think how elated you will feel knowing you have helped others by helping yourself.</p>

<p>If you look at things with an appreciative attitude your life will change. Yes your life will change as well as others, indeed for the better. You are an inspirational person.</p>

  </header>

    <p>There are many different careers in the field of accounting ranging from entry-level bookkeeping to the Chief Financial Officer of a company. To achieve positions with more responsibility and higher salaries, it’s necessary to have a degree in accounting as well as achieve various professional designations.</p>

<p>One of the primary milestones in any accountant’s career is to become a Certified Public Accountant or CPA. To become a CPA you have to go to college with a major in accounting. You also have to pass a national CPA exam. There’s also some employment experience required in a CPA firm. This is generally one to two years, although this varies from state to state. Once you satisfy all those requirements, you get a certificate that designates you as a CPA and you’re allowed to offer your services to the public.</p>

<p>Many consider this just one stepping stone to their careers. The chief accountant in many offices is called the controller. The controller is in charge of managing the entire accounting system in a business stays on top of accounting and tax laws to keep the company legal and is responsible for preparing the financial statements.</p>

<p>The controller is also in charge of financial planning and budgeting. Some companies have only one accounting professional who’s essentially the chief cook and bottle washer and does everything. As a business grows in size and complexity, then additional layers of personnel are required to handle the volume of work that comes from growth. Other areas in the company are also impacted by growth, and it’s part of the controller’s job to determine just how many more salaries the company can pay for additional people without negatively impacting growth and profits.</p>

<p>The controller also is responsible for preparing tax returns for the business; a much more involved and complex task than completing personal income tax forms! In larger organizations, the controller can report to a vice president of finance who reports to the chief financial officer, who is responsible for the broad objectives for growth and profit and implementing the appropriate strategies to achieve the objectives.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Depression can come on us at any time of the year. Sometimes, holidays are the worst times for those that feel this down-in-the-dumps fear and worry and things just seem to happen to make us feel gloomy and sad. Note that this feeling happens to all of us at one time or another. How to recognize the feeling and know what to do about it is the purpose of this article.</p>

<p>No one can or should ignore this feeling. It is universal and the blues are very much ingrained in our world. Music and movies are legendary in handling this subject. If the feeling is too overwhelming, then sometimes professional help is the desired action. We will just talk here about the funk of depression, the knotted thinking that nothing is right and it will only get worse. The following things are suggested to help:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Laughing is the best medicine is an old adage, but so true. It is amazing how when you are depressed, just laughing about something and releasing the stress, can make you feel better. If you are having trouble finding something to laugh about, maybe you can find some people to keep close that cheer you up, that you can call when you feel bad, those who you know will let you apply the “strength in numbers” theory. Invite a few good friends over just to talk and have an appetizer and you will see how much better you feel afterwords.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Listening to music is another key to overcoming depression. If you can just relax and let the type of music you love drift over you and enter your senses, you will find that you calm down and feel better. Even as we respond to music. Maybe you will find you want to get up and dance and there is nothing wrong with that – even without a partner! Just move to the beat and let all your stress flow out of your fingertips and toes.</p>
