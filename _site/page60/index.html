  </header>

    <p>I used to wonder whether the economic recession is due for repetition by observing the various events around the globe and especially in Europe. The nations like Greece and Spain are in the process of introducing various austerity measures. But the million dollar question is whether they are going to bail out the ailing economy and drive the growth.</p>

<p>As I read in an article, the observation by the leading economist Mr. Stiglitz discloses a different picture. According to his judgement, the present approach by Greece and Spain is not going to yield the desired result. Alternatively, they are bounds to confound the problem by reducing the tax collection and public spending. When they said approach was followed in Brazil and Argentina, the result was not positive to tackle the issue. Argentina could not come out of the problem completely while Brazil was able to manage the debt due to the over liquidity.</p>

<p>Every country wants to get rid of the deficit by resorting to austerity measures that are not going to fuel the economic growth. It is advisable to go in for the debt restructuring by the nations and even debt write-off if needed to maintain the growth momentum. Like Brazil, the nation can grow once the market is rationalized. However, the interest rate must be under control and preferably kept at low level to spur the growth to tackle all the issues in the long-term perspective.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Nowadays many economists come out with their own prediction on the economic growth when the global turmoil on the economic front is haunting the globe. For the year 2011 it is expected that the global growth will be in the order of 3.8 percent. Also, the purchasing parity is estimated to strike a level of not less than 4.1 percent compared to 3.60 percent arrived at during January 2010.</p>

<p>The major uncertainty that is expected to make and mar the estimate of economic growth is said to be the European crisis. The Euro zone crisis is sure to affect the leading economies like China as they are not decoupled with the crisis in Europe. Though the economists predict a better level of growth, the momentum is expected to be little slow in 2010</p>

<p>As I read through various articles, the situation is not so encouraging unless the nations take appropriate steps to revamp their strategies to tackle the issue. Overheated economy like China must think about increasing the interest rate and ensuring the flexibility in the value of the Yuan to assist the global recovery. The policy makers of various nations must arrive at a consensus to ensure healthy economic growth without affecting the other nations for sustained global recovery.</p>

  </header>

    <p>When we are coming across many bank failure worldwide, the fear of declaring bankruptcy by many more is haunting everyone. I could observe the urgency shown in the recent meeting at Busan in North Korea port city by the G 20 nations to discipline the various countries to ensure a healthy and strong financial system.</p>

<p>The matter of introducing the Bank Tax was discussed as a tool to avoid the collapse of banks in the future. Countries like the USA and Europe proposed such bank tax to develop a buffer to meet out any bank bail out in the future. This fund will help the banks in distress to meet their capital requirement and also to ensure better liquidity at the time of crisis.</p>

<p>In fact, as I have my own reservation on such a move, few of the countries comprised under BRIC rightly expressed their reservation to go in for bank tax as the regulatory system in their countries, do not warrant such introduction. Though the critics comment that such opposition as a “short sightedness” the developing countries are not willing for such proposal.</p>

<p>An ongoing financial structural system with proper regulatory control is expected to put the banks on a healthy track without the need for such taxing reforms.</p>

  </header>

    <p>“Money Growing on Trees” sounds little incredible, but one has to believe it to the core if the matter I read in one of the newspaper is trusted and analysed for a while. The conservation of the rain forest trees is assuring the money needed for the development in the African countries like Gabon, Ghana Kenya and Liberia.</p>

<p>You will be astonished to know that Africa had lost as much as 3.4 million hectares of forest lands and the precious trees on it in the last 10 years a per the recent report of UN Food and Agricultural Organization. One can easily visualize the amount of carbon that is released to the atmosphere due to the falling of trees in such a vast area. It is estimated that one hectare of such rain forest trees is believed to store between 100 to 300 tonnes of carbon.</p>

<p>A country like Liberia can easily sell the carbon unit under the Clean development Mechanism to the developed countries where the emission of carbon is higher the limit prescribed by the KYOTA protocol. They can buy the carbon credit from these African countries if they are able to maintain the rain forest trees for the international expectation and use the sum for their development projects. Every country should venture to explore the possibility of such conservation to mint money from the tree.</p>

    <p>Ayurveda is a branch of medicine practiced in Asian countries and to certain extent in the western world too. It cures the diseases without any side-effects and more so the ill effects that are observed in the other types of medicines. Medicinal plants are used to extract the medicine in scientific way and the same is available in capsules also like any other medicine. The medicinal plants are grown in a clean and hygienic conditions and various research are under taken to find out their suitability to cure various ailments. It is vouched that Ayurveda treatment is better than that of Homeo medicines. Many countries are having government owned medicinal plats farms where in pool of medicinal plants are preserved and grown</p>

    <p>Climate Change is the greatest threaten the globe is facing in the light of the excess carbon emission. Countries like the USA emits six times more CO2 into the atmosphere when compared to the developing nations. The impact of such climatic change is already observed in the forms of unprecedented melting of the glaciers and the sudden down pour in various parts of the world. Flood and drought are the resultant phenomenon due to the climatically change. Developed countries like the USA and Europe need to think in terms of reducing their energy consumption thereby helping the other nations to have less impact on account of climatically change. Developing countries too should go a slow in energy consumption to avoid pollution.</p>

    <p>Electric cars are slowly picking up in various countries. Battery operated vehicles are coming to the markets and many cars producers are diverting towards this sun rise sector. This has been compelled by the rising fuel cost coupled with the atmospheric pollution due to the use of petroleum driven cars. Small cars with reasonable speed are invented to begin with to suit the road condition and other infrastructures to recharge the energy. Once this sector grows it is going to be very big boom for the human kind as it reduces the cost of maintenance apart from helping the world to minimize the global warming.</p>

    <p>Alternative Energy is to be scouted by those countries, who depend mainly on electricity and Petro products. The cost of oil is draining the exchequer of various nations. It is high time that the alternative sources of energy like solar energy, bio gas, wind energy and tidal energy are produced wherever the nature favours the same. Solar energy is available in abundance in the globe and it can be put in to best use in the field of rural electrification. Many hotels and the hospitals use the solar energy by having their own arrangement. In fact, the realty sector in different countries are coming out with projects, inclusive of solar energy units in the housing units to take care of the house hold requirement like lighting and cooking. This is not only cost saving, but also environmental friendly.</p>
