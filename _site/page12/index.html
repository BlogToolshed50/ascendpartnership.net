  </header>

    <p>Gardening is one of the simplest and most fruitful, pun intended, hobbies in the country. Even those in the urban areas are rapidly discovering the wonders of this activity. So although they don’t have the garden patch on their backyard that they can show off, they make one several feet above the ground in their condominium units and apartment buildings.</p>

<p>Gardening, after all, does not only involve a large patch of land. One can actually do gardening in pots. Even taking care of orchids and other aerial plants are also considered gardening. Starting small is actually quirt good especially if you do not have much experience yet. Not all people have a green thumb and it is best to take care of only a few so that you will be able to fully focus on each of the plants.</p>

<p>Remember that gardening may look as simple as watering them every morning and putting fertilizers, but the task is more than that. It actually involves a lot of work and can take a great deal of time especially if you have many plants to take care of.</p>

<p>Most people think that gardening is only for aesthetic purposes but the fact is, there are a lot of things that gardening can offer, not only to people but also to the environment. Below are just some of the benefits that one can get from gardening. Read on and you might be encouraged to get on with the craze.</p>

<p>Relaxation</p>

<p>Although it may indeed involve a lot of work, from watering the plants to cutting the unwanted shrubs in the surrounding areas, gardening relaxes people. This is especially true with people who are already used to the task and are simply enjoying the “flowers” of their labor.</p>

<p>Gardening, in fact, has been known to be effective therapy with people who are depressed or those with manic tendencies. Plants soothes the emotions and calms the person.</p>

<p>Clean air</p>

<p>Science books have told us that plants inhale carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen, an air that we need to survive. When there are plants in the house, the air is healthier as plants already filter the air when they make food and then give off clean air. This is the reason why people find cleaner air in the suburbs compared to the cities… perhaps because there are more trees there than in the rustle-bustle of urban areas.</p>

<p>Cooler</p>

<p>The home with plants is also cooler than those that do not have any. This is because of the shades that plants provide. The branches and the leaves of the plants protect the house from the direct rays of the sun and of course the leaves in itself absorb the sunlight. Plants need the sunlight to make or process their own food.</p>

<p>Eye-appealing</p>

<p>Hands down, a house with plants and flowers is more beautiful than any house with great architectural design. Having plants at home provides flashes of colors that are wonderful to look at especially when combined with the general design of the house. Especially good in providing aesthetic appeal are orchids and sunflowers which provide a cheery and bright atmosphere to any home.</p>

<p>Food on the table</p>

<p>You can actually choose to plant vegetables that you and your family can enjoy at the dining table. This actually beats having to buy veggies in the market because you know that what you have planted is clean and free from pesticides and other chemicals that are used in commercial planting.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Whether you’re an artist, a writer, an online business owner or somewhere in between your efforts likely require a healthy mix of creative thinking. In fact creativity and innovation are crucial for business success or to excel in most any other type vocation.</p>

<p>Realizing the important role creativity plays in your professional efforts it is vital to maintain a continual flow of fresh new creative ideas. Unfortunately we all experience times when this flow slows to a trickle and sometimes even stops. Coming up with even a single creative idea seems to be an insurmountable challenge. What do you do when this happens?</p>

<p>In order to ‘recharge’ your mind and get those innovative thoughts flowing again a change of venue is usually a good first step.</p>

<p>Let’s have a look at 7 different ways to stimulate your thinking thus allowing your mind to develop more cutting edge ideas for use in business or everyday problem solving.</p>

<p>Reach out to Family and Friends</p>

<p>If you’ve got an online business discuss with family or friends what it is you do and how they think you can improve upon it. Perhaps they feel you’re products are too expensive or maybe just don’t solve the problems they want solved. Listen to their feedback and take notes.</p>

<p>What’s in the News</p>

<p>Check out what’s going on in the world. Generally the bad part about any news broadcast is that they’re so negative. Well negativity implies there are problems so identify them and consider any solutions that may address these problems.</p>

<p>Review Your Past Mistakes</p>

<p>Review your own past and examine mistakes you’ve made. Were the mistakes you made common or could they have been avoided and if so, how? You’re looking for ideas here so don’t let this turn into a ‘self flogging’ session.</p>

<p>Brainstorm with Friends</p>

<p>This need not be a formal gathering nor does it need to be like work. Chill out, kick back and be casual. Have fun in this relaxed environment and treat this like a game such as word association or scrabble. Discussing something like ‘what ticks you off most about…..’ and then let the sparks fly. No doubt a creative idea or two will result from these exchanges.</p>

<p>Introduce New Solutions</p>

<p>Ignoring any current solutions and focus more on the problem these solutions were made for. Consider a different approach to solving the problem. Your solution may be more convenient, economical or possibly environmentally friendlier.</p>

<p>Peruse Forums</p>

<p>Online forums are a great source of information but they are also a great place to find out what is on the minds of others. What bothers them or what pressing and consistent need is out there that has gone unanswered?</p>

<p>Finding a Niche in the Existing Solution</p>

<p>Look at current or popular products that offer solutions to pre-existing problems. Have they fully addressed the problem or is something left unsolved?</p>

<p>Approach this ‘sliver of opportunity’ by considering a solution for just this one area. Focus on the smaller problem areas the existing solutions didn’t solve and consider a solution for just it.</p>

<p>Creative thinking is a resource upon which many rely in order to achieve any type of success. The ability to introduce creativity and innovation into your efforts is what keeps you on the cutting edge and a step ahead of the competition. Whether it’s for business success, personal achievement or simply problem solving there will always be the need for fresh new creative ideas. Losing, even temporarily, the ability to think creatively can severely hinder your efforts or business growth. The 7 techniques we discussed above are great ways to stimulate creative thoughts that will keep you or your business continually moving forward.</p>

    <p>Performance appraisals, performance reviews, performance feedback – they all refer to the same process that is very much part and parcel of working in large organizations. That doesn’t mean that smaller companies do not conduct performance appraisals, but they tend to do it less formally.</p>

<p>Performance feedback is clearly a necessary evil, as it allows a company to reward and recognize its best employees to motivate them further. For employees who aren’t performing at optimum levels, it provides a structured way of working with the employees to raise their performance.</p>

<p>From an employee’ perspective, it is thus critical to ensure that your performance appraisals capture the best of your work during the period under review. The performance appraisal form becomes a permanent record that will have an impact on your career not only in the same organization, but may also be used as reference if requested by a future employer.</p>

<p>Obviously the most important thing to include in your performance feedback is achievement of your business goals or metrics. List down the key metrics and provide supporting evidence on how you achieved those goals. Include also challenges or obstacles that you managed to overcome.</p>

<p>Regardless of the industry, company or role you’re in, incorporate the following 5 key strengths in your performance appraisals. There is great emphasis on these values as they form the foundation for a company’s corporate culture, and are critical for its survival and long-term growth.</p>

<p>Key Strength # 1: Focus on customer satisfaction – describe how you contribute to increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty for the company’s long-term growth.</p>

<p>Key Strength # 2: Teamwork and collaboration – highlight how you build lasting relationships with other teams and work collaboratively to achieve common goals.</p>

<p>Key Strength # 3: Open communications – emphasize your willingness to listen to new ideas, or to adopt alternative approaches</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Key Strength # 4: Interpersonal skills – stress your ability to work with all levels within the organization.</p>

<p>Key Strength # 5: Adaptability to change – illustrate how you’re able to adapt in the face of constant changes in the organization or industry</p>

<p>High ratings in these areas will enhance your technical or functional expertise, and will make you a more valuable player within the organization.</p>

    <p>James chapter one says,</p>

<p>Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.</p>

<p>But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it—he will be blessed in what he does.</p>

<p>(James 1:23-25 NIV)</p>

<p>What’s she gotten into now? What do you mean she’s left the church? She’s joined a cult! Are we going to find her at the airport hanging out and playing finger cymbals? These are a few of the comments I received from exuberant family members over my new found faith in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>An inherent tendency to walk on the wild side brought with it several run-ins in my life. After run-ins with the law, run-ins with misery, run-ins with alcohol abuse, I finally had a run-in into the loving arms of Jesus.</p>

<p>But being the spirited person that I am, my family’s traditional church just did not equal the blazing passion stirring in my heart for God so I started attending a more spirited church.</p>

<p>A radical change in my heart brought about radical changes in my life. Good-time Charlie’s heart had undergone a circumcision and I was no longer known for being the life of the party. There was a period of time where unproductive and even detrimental relationships had to be put aside in order to lay a solid foundation in my life with God.</p>

<p>When is my past ever going to be the past? I cried out to the Lord, one day. But, I knew in my heart a clean break with the past was necessary unless I wanted the Hunch Back of Notre Dame to continue to lurk around in the shadows of my life.</p>

<p>The further and closer one walks with God, the further away the past becomes. In Christ, I was a new creature with new features so to try to continue in my old pattern of life would be unwise.</p>

<p>The lull of a light conversation naturally caused my guard to go down as I was speaking to a close relative on the phone. Suddenly, out of nowhere, came yet one more tongue-lashing concerning my changed life. Who knows, perhaps they would have been more accepting if I’d chosen a career in prostitution and drug sales.</p>

<p>You’re nothing but a wall flower with no friends, was one of the statements that stuck in my heart the most. Hanging up the phone, sobbing and at my wits end, I stood in my kitchen and cried out to God, What am I going to do?</p>

<p>That day the Lord visited me in my distress. By the Holy Spirit, He spoke words of comfort and encouragement to me. He said, Sandra, you need to see yourself as I see you. In Me, you are a new creature, the old things have passed away—behold, all things have become new. It needs to be that when words like that come to you, it will be as ridiculous as if someone would tell you that you have big purple ears and a nose like an elephant.</p>

<p>You can laugh at that because you know it’s not true, since you looked in the mirror this morning and saw what you really look like. It’s the same way when you look in My Word, as you read you will see a reflection of the new creature that you are in Christ.</p>

<p>His Shield of Protection</p>

<p>The Lord continued to impress upon my heart how His Word produces faith. It becomes a shield of faith and that shield is to be put in front of me to quench the fiery darts of the enemy. Suddenly, I saw how a shield is not an extracting instrument to remove these flaming darts but protects me before they even get a chance to penetrate my heart.</p>

<p>The truths the Lord spoke to me that day literally changed my outlook. Moreover, discouraging statements no longer had the same sting. With my shield of faith in place, critical words lost their venom since I was now hearing, Hey, you have big purple ears and a nose like an elephant!</p>

<p>Ha, ha, ha! That is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard given the fact that I’ve looked in the mirror of God’s Word and know the Truth—the truth that set me free!</p>

<p>Now, after witnessing God’s faithfulness in my life over the years, my relatives have come to appreciate my new lifestyle. My family actually respects me. Sometimes, they even call me for prayer and encouragement.</p>

<p>As a missionary the last several years, I’ve been privileged to travel abroad and to speak for Him in many different nations, especially Europe. I now have lots of international friendships.</p>

    <p>In selecting the finest greenhouse designs, much weight have to be given on function. Sure, it will not hurt to possess the finest fashioned greenhouse around the neighborhood, but it must not be at the sacrifice of having a fully effective greenhouse that definitely meets your needs as a harvester.</p>

<p>Numerous things should be regarded in going over blueprints for a greenhouse. Few of those points you ought to keep in mind are:</p>

<p>Measurement of the greenhouse</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are you happy with the size of certain greenhouse blueprints? Does it allow the needed space for plants you are planning to grow? Does the design maximize the space of the greenhouse?</li>
</ul>

<p>Weather in your Area</p>

<ul>
  <li>The layout you’ve picked should be best suited for the kind of temperature you have in your location. Elements like the amount of spontaneous rainfall, snow, and span of seasons are some of the stuff you have to take note of.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kind of Materials</p>

<ul>
  <li>What kind of materials did the greenhouse blueprints require? Is it best suited for the weather in your area? Is it suited for your needs? For example, if you are going to use the greenhouse all year long and the winter season can be very long in your location, pvc greenhouse wouldn’t do as it can’t hold snow fall and the heat retention can be very poor considering the glazing that you are going to use for a PVC greenhouse. You’ll be needing a sturdier greenhouse. A good consideration for materials in this case would be wood.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ventilation, Irrigation</p>

<ul>
  <li>For a number of blueprints for a greenhouse, setting up of a system to provide well ventilated and irrigated greenhouse is not required. Providing suitable ventilation can be as basic as opening the panes and watering cans can be used for simple and smaller greenhouses. On the other hand for other bigger building, the greenhouse plans should be sensitive to such matters. An instance would be is to check that the location and measurement of the vents are suited for the turnover rate of the air.</li>
</ul>

<p>The best thing is to search for a heat generation system that is perfect for the area and measurement detailed in your greenhouse blueprints.</p>

  </header>

    <p>My baby can read, so I know, for parents, nothing makes them feel prouder than knowing that their child’s skills are developing way ahead of other kids their age. Can you imagine how accomplished and proud you will feel as a parent if you have a baby who can read between the ages of three months to four years old?</p>

<p>Letting You In On the Secret of How to Get Your Baby to Read</p>

<p>Typically, a child learns to read one he or she goes to school. As a parent, is there anything that you can do from your end to get your child to develop reading skills prior to formal schooling?</p>

<p>When you go online, you will see a good number of products on how you can turn your baby into the next Einstein by developing the child’s academic skills at an early age. Specifically, there are products which include a set of DVDs, books and other teaching materials that will get your child reading at an early age. How are you supposed to do this, exactly, without having to purchase these usually expensive products?</p>

<p>Many experts agree that a child’s mind from birth up to about four years old absorbs information like a sponge. You can actually use this fact to your advantage by getting your three-month old baby to read. The following section will let you in on the secret on how you can do just that.</p>

<p>Top Tips on How to Get You Saying “My Baby Can Read!”</p>

<p>Take a look at the following tips on how you can get your baby to read:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When teaching your baby how to read, make sure to present the printed words in large font.</li>
</ol>

<p>First, prepare the materials that you will be using to get your child to read. Chalkboards, dry erase boards, or simply a piece of paper and a marker. Once you have the materials, make sure to print each word in large font. As young as their minds are, babies will learn a lot easier and quicker if they have the visuals to go along with the words that you are teaching them to learn.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first set of words which you can teach your baby to read should be familiar to them.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you’re trying to get your child to learn, make sure that he or she is already familiar with the words that you will be teaching in the first place. Mommy and daddy, body parts, the things which can be seen around the playroom, animals or</p>

<p>colours are a few of the things that you can start with.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the flash cards method.</li>
</ol>

<p>You should teach your baby to read in a room which has very little distraction. Then, use the flashcards method which should be visually stimulating enough to catch your child’s attention. Flash each written word in front of your child, perhaps with a bold illustration on the side, and say the word out loud. Do it one after another and each word can be taught up to three times a day. Your child would absorb the information like a sponge.</p>

<ol>
  <li>After getting your baby to read or learn a few words, up the ante and put the words together so that a sentence can be formed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s say that your child has already learned five, ten or twenty words. His or her reading will not necessarily be developed unless you start putting the words together in a sentence or an entire story.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Harness the power of baby reading videos.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a good number of baby reading videos which are available in the market today. Use these to combine visuals and sound so that you can effectively teach your baby how to read. The Your Baby Can Read Program does an excellent job of this.</p>

<p>All in all, your child’s brain processes information at incredibly high rates between the ages of three months to five years. If you want to take advantage of this fact to get your baby reading at one year old, then you should apply one of the many ways that you can get your child to read at a very young age.</p>

<p>My baby can read because we applied these simple principals and I am confident you can do the same if you follow a plan and stick to it.</p>

    <p>There is always room for some improvement, but for that you have to accept the reality that you are not Mr. Perfect and there are chances of some improvement, in your behavior, attitude or thinking. Process of learning management skills is never ending task, some learn it through motivational thoughts, keynotes other chooses to attend workshops and seminars and these ideas are quite beneficial for leaders and managers</p>

<p>If you want to be a successful manager, first and foremost thing you should know is to accept the reality about your self, whether agreeable to you or not, it is important to know how other perceives you as a leader or mangers, and try to match with expectation of good leader.</p>

<p>Treat your employee with respect and trust: Your employees work for you, it did not give you the authority over them treat them with equality and respect, trust your staff, it is a vital component of the leadership it is your trust that make your employee an asset for the organization.</p>

<p>Be a good listener, it is the characteristic feature of successful leadership; always playing the role of solution provider can be harmful try to be a good listener first.</p>

<p>A leader is successful if his team is successful, your victory is not yours, share it with your team mate, it was their effort that make you a successful leader, never forget to acknowledge their contribution in your success.</p>

<p>Try to make working environment light and easy, a blend of humor in your working strategies will help your employee in giving their best rather in pressurized in tensed situation.</p>

<p>Be friendly with your employee, let them know their real boss, not the one who is trying to be the boss, the genuineness and originality in your behavior is very much needed for the successful leadership.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Evolution is the movement of energy toward a higher expression or manifestation of a higher complex structure. Energy is always kinetic, though it may appear at times to be static or potential; it is constantly in movement, ceaselessly forming and transforming its structure into something that it was not before. Thus, whatever appears as form, as an energy-structure, is always in a state of flux or becoming. This may not be apparent outwardly to the senses, but it is inherently so in the atomic and subatomic levels. This becoming may result in an improvement or degradation of what it was before. Nature always work along the lines of evolution, even if degradation or involution seems to be evident. This is the mystery of the principle of Shiva, the destroyer, working to break things down so that a new cycle of growth may be implemented by Brahma, or the creative principle. Vishnu is the stabilizer principle. This principle maintains the creative expression until its purpose or mission has been attained or fulfilled, it then devolves its work to the Shivaic principle of destruction. The Shivaic principle is catabolic while the Brahmic principle is anabolic. The process may be illustrated thus:</p>

<p>Brahma (Creation</p>

<p>Being (The Absolute) –Motion –Change or Becoming–Vishnu (Preservation)–Evolution</p>

<p>Shiva (Destruction)</p>

<p>Evolution may be considered from the physical or metaphysical aspect. In occult circles, it is often customary to consider man’s growth from the metaphysical or spiritual standpoint. Man as a microcosm possesses various components in his holistic being, and each component or aspect is constantly being transmuted to a higher or lower expression–to a more refined or coarse state, to a higher or a lower vibration, to a more sublime or degraded condition. Above we said that Nature always work along the lines of evolution even if degradation seems apparent. This also applies to human beings. We may sometimes cause ourselves to temporarily retrograde by being periodically despondent, depressed and negative; however, this should be a period of introspection in order to build a new condition of value, to reinforce our spiritual connection with our Source; still, the problem is that some would sustain this state of retrogression, the status quo, and not bounce back to a balanced condition, or to be centered in one’s spiritual nature. This is opposing the natural evolutionary current. Those that cooperate with Nature will evolve much more quickly than those who oppose her. It is like swimming against the current. How do we cooperate with Nature? By first knowing and understanding her laws and how they may be implemented; by being aware of her forces and how they may be harnessed and applied creatively; by knowing how to align oneself with the higher purpose of being.</p>

<p>All of the kingdoms of nature with the “exceptions” of the kingdom of human beings and the other higher kingdoms have external agencies and Intelligences directing their evolutionary growth. Animals, for instance, do not have conscious control over their soul-growth, they are dependent upon the creative Intelligence called “group-spirits” in the direction of their evolution and the tending after their welfare. In spiritual parlance we call these group-spirits, “angels.” That angels are behind the innate intelligence of animals may possibly be ridiculed by orthodox science, however, from metaphysical investigations this is indeed a fact. It often surprises us, even to non-animal lovers, of the intelligence and creativity displayed by God’s creatures. That animals are controlled, directed, taught, or inspired by angelic agencies may explain the phenomenon of the “100th Monkey Syndrome.” It has been observed that even though a creature be separated by miles of water from members of its species, when it learns something new this new information is somehow relayed to these other members living elsewhere. This could be explained by animal telepathy, however, the angelic guardian theory is equally valid.</p>

<p>Unlike animals and the nature spirits, or the creatures of the ether and astral realms, human beings may well personally participate and cooperate with Nature in accelerating their evolutionary growth should they desire to do so. In fact personal participation is advisable because even though we actually live in an eternal, timeless state, and “lots of time” to evolve, there is a cosmic timetable that we should deeply consider. This can be compared to the situation that we have in our educational system. We can progress from level to level according to the educational plan and ultimately fit ourselves in society, or we can stay back year after year at the same level without any personal development or the desire to progress. In the latter situation we cause our growth to be stagnated; on the other hand, if we work hard enough, we would progress and mature in concordance with the system.</p>

<p>The above illustration applies to our present world situation. We are spiritually at the brink of the closing of a certain cosmic timetable–a certain planetary and solar cycle. If we do not accelerate our consciousness, uplift our spirits, raise our vibrations and frequency, express our divinity, evolve the components constituting our microcosmic being, and liberate ourselves from the entrapment of matter, then we may find ourselves ousted from the progressive wave of humanity and directed to stay in a cosmic situation that would probably cause some psychological torture. Concisely, we become spiritual laggards if we do not evolve with our spiritual group. In the closing cycle, if we spiritually progress we enter into the “Kingdom of the Gods.” If we lag behind in consciousness and spirituality, we would not follow the progressive ones but maintain our pathetic condition in the Kingdom of Human Beings, and perhaps not on this planet. The spiritual harvest mentioned in Holy Writ will indeed take place. In the Scriptures we are told that there would be a separation between goats and sheep, between wheat and weeds. Scientifically, there would be a radical “natural selection” in the near-future based upon soul-frequency. Those vibrating at a frequency-range above the specified level would be “saved.” Conversely, those vibrating below the specified level would not make the grade.</p>

<p>Why are we on Earth, and why on earth are we here? Evolution is an eternal creative Cosmic law. It is a creative expression of Being–or at our level–truly being what we are. This applies to all entities or Intelligences of the omnivore. Evolution, therefore, is God’s plan and purpose for us all. Flowing with the evolutionary current reveals more and more of what we are and our relationship with the Whole, with the One, with All That Is. This is the reason why man incarnated in the physical plane. Humanity is here to evolve their Divine Self-awareness, their remembrance of who they really are, and quicken their sense of oneness with the illusory, fragmentary parts of the Whole.</p>

<p>Because of the resistance and inertia of matter, the physical plane offers a unique platform in assisting and quickening soul-growth. One would not evolve as quickly in the higher dimensions as one would in the physical realm, for in the higher dimensions time and space are non-existent, and astral substance is easily mold-able by the mind and the will. In the higher realms there is no struggle or effort needed to exist and subsist, hence, not much unfold-ment of divine qualities that would evolve the soul. It is different in the physical dimension. Here we must be active in supporting and maintaining life, in establishing ourselves in the world, in producing values that would improve mundane conditions, in manifesting heaven on earth. Such tasks unfold the many divine characteristics lying dormant or latent in our soul-being. Our spiritual task is not solely to free ourselves from karma or to liberate ourselves from the wheel of reincarnation, for at one time we were free from those two conditions and the ties of the lower worlds, and yet, we “fell” and descended into the physical world.</p>
