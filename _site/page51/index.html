      <a class="post-link" href="/2010/08/18/counting-your-chicken-before-they-hatch/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Counting Your Chicken Before They Hatch!</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Have you ever heard the expression, “Do not count your chickens before they hatch?” Maybe an older, I suggest that you first do a Must Have, Why, How analysis.</p>

<p>First, write down a list of must haves; bigger home, luxury trips, new cars, work from home, etc. Then decide why these must haves are important to you and prioritize them. Lastly, write down how you are going to get the must haves.</p>

<p>Also, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<p>Why do I not have what I want now?</p>

<p>What are the tools and resources do I need?</p>

<p>What past experiences are in the way?</p>

<p>Who can I talk to that has already succeeded?</p>

<p>How am I paying for this?</p>

<p>What are the tradeoffs?</p>

<p>What am I going to give up?</p>

<p>From this analysis, start writing down you goals. Remember, without a start, there cannot be an ending. Denis Watley stated “The reason most people never reach their goals is that they do not define them, or ever seriously consider them as believable or achievable. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way, and who will be sharing the adventure with them.”</p>

<p>Once finished writing your goals, next you need to start visualizing your dreams. Henry David Thoreau once said “If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.” You need image yourself accomplishing your goals and obtaining your treasures. Will yourself into succeeding. Never think that you cannot reach your desired results. Talk about the desires as if you have already obtained it. A good practice is to read your goals daily. If you are having a bad day, read them over and over.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Guest post written by Jeff Noble</p>

<p>My drive home from high school took me by a little diner that had a lot of great flavors of ice cream. It was too tempting most days and I stopped there to get some quite often. Most of the time I got a flavor called Superman that’s neon rainbow and is supposedly just vanilla flavor with different colors. But I swear it tastes differently.</p>

<p>That flavor isn’t as popular as its supposed counterpart, so I can’t find it that often where I live now. There isn’t a shortage of ice cream shops, any search on wild blue satellite tv will prove that, but unfortunately a lot of those shops are small and don’t list flavors on their websites.</p>

<p>That’s why it’s been such a hassle to track down which ones have it. But when I find ones that I do have it, I make sure to comment on their websites or user reviews with my wild blue internet Kansas that they do have it.</p>

<p>I’ve finally tracked down a few that have the Superman flavor, but I know there have to be others out there like me that love the flavor and have the same trouble finding it.</p>

    <p>To deal with structured cabling contractor is quite a challenging one. I realized this while finishing up the wiring work in my new multi-unit office. Being a company, we had to get our network cables perfectly placed across all our racks. The slightest mistake in doing so would affect us our business a lot. Our servers had down that times our customers really displeasure and hence we were seeking the best electrical contractor who has experts in this field.</p>

<p>Apart form the internet cable layout, it was really important to get the telephone, fax and other electrical wiring in place. There are many service providers who claim to undertake these large cable installations, but we need cabling contractor who offer quality service. Especially in cable installation tasks, lot depends on the quality of the product itself in addition to the skill sets of the data cabling installers.</p>

<p>In our case we had a vendor who failed in both aspects. The good news was that, when I came across mason247.com that is a data cabling installation company and offer a variety of cable contracting services serving large scale offices and buildings. They are experienced in their business and I believe that they are the best service provider of telecommunication solutions.</p>

  </header>

    <p>You should be able to find several indispensable facts about Affiliate Marketing in Your Own Website</p>

<p>The most important and indispensable tool in Affiliate Marketing is your own website. The first step in any successful affiliate marketing business is building a good, credible and professional looking website. Your website is the jump off point of all your marketing efforts. Thus, you must first build a user-friendly website, which will appeal to your prospects and encourage them to click on the links to the products and service you are promoting and make a purchase. Therefore, you must first concentrate your efforts in building a website that will cater to what your prospects need.</p>

<p>The most important thing you should consider is that almost all web users go online to look for information, not necessarily to go and buy something. Above all else, make your website full of original, relevant and useful content. People will love articles that are appealing and helpful. Keep in mind that, in the internet, content is still king and good quality content will not only build your credibility, it can also help you achieve a higher search engine ranking. By posting relevant and useful articles, you establish yourself as a credible expert in the field, making you a more trustworthy endorser of the product or service you promote. Establishing a good reputation is a good step in building up a loyal consumer base.</p>
