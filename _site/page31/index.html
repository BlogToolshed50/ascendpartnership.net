  </header>

    <p>Advanced technology has truly helped make people’s lives easier, more convenient and even healthier. Just take the case of the water we use every day whether for personal, commercial or industrial use. Thanks to the technology, we are now able to savor pure, fresh water without having to worry about its effects on our health and on the things we use them for.</p>

<p>The sea vessels like sail or power boats and yachts, the marine water maker makes use of the desalination system to remove salt and other substances from water and make it suitable for use on board from washing down the boat, cooking, drinking, washing the dishes, making ice, bathing and doing the laundry.</p>

<p>The sea water desalinator is very inexpensive but the benefits you can get is enormous. Besides being economical, it can also save time and effort and most of its running costs is actually just for the cost of electricity. And if used properly with the right routine maintenance, this device can last up to 20 years.</p>

<p>A desalinator on board can save the boat owner money as he no longer needs to buy purified water elsewhere for use while on his vessel. Also, he does not need to store several gallons of water on board which would otherwise just add on weight to the boat, take up much space and increase its fuel consumption. This, of course, allows the vessel to take longer voyages and at a faster speed to boot.</p>

<p>In addition, a desalinator on board is very convenient as it allows you to do many things similar to what you do at home like cooking, bathing, washing dishes and clothes without having to worry about contamination or conserving water. And with fresh water always available, washing your boat is easy and requires little effort in drying it. Fresh water also helps protect the boat’s rigging and hull.</p>

<p>A desalinator utilizes the reverse osmosis system in purifying seawater. Fifty years ago, this system was originally developed to make clean water for industrial use. It is considered the most rigid method of water purification in a large scale. But through the years, its usage has expanded to home water purifiers. Reverse osmosis takes place when pressurized seawater passes through a semi-permeable membrane where up to 99 percent of salts, contaminants and pollutants are removed. The semi-permeable membrane allows only water to pass through but not ions or larger molecules such as bacteria, glucose or urea. So at the other end of the membrane, fresh, potable water is produced from either seawater, salty bore water or recycled water.</p>

<p>A desalinator is normally operated for only part of the day from four to six hours depending on the amount of fresh water needed. To determine the gallon per hour rating, first find out where pure water will be used and the daily amount needed then divide the total gallon usage.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2011/02/21/how-safe-is-your-childs-school/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">How Safe Is Your Child&#8217;s School?</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>As a parent, have you ever thought about whether your child’s school was designed and built with security in mind?</p>

<p>To raise awareness of school safety and security issues, tools and tips on how schools can be made safer and more secure for students and staff.</p>

<p>There are several basic measures that schools can take to help ensure a secure learning environment for children. The National Crime Prevention Council offers the following guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Visitors should be required to sign in or show proper identification.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unmonitored doors should be locked from the outside at all times to prevent unauthorized persons or items from entering the building unnoticed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Students entering and exiting the school property should be monitored.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The receptionist should be equipped with a panic button for emergencies, a camera with a monitor at another location and a high-security lock on the front door that can be controlled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Access to identification badges, office keys and codes should be restricted and a process for reporting missing badges and keys should be in place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All doors should have high-security locks or electronic access control units. This applies especially to closets that have private information or hazardous materials, as well as outside doors and basements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Motion-sensitive and constant lights should be used outdoors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dark places around the building should be illuminated and shrubs should be cut back so light can penetrate these areas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stairwells and out-of-the-way corridors should be well-lighted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All doors should be solid. Sheet steel should cover both sides of the back and basement doors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Door frames and hinges should be strong enough to prevent them from being pried open.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The National Crime Prevention Council suggests that parents talk to their children’s principal and work with the school’s PTA to encourage the school to implement these measures. If they remain concerned, they can team up with other parents to insist that their local school board make building security one of its top priorities.</p>
