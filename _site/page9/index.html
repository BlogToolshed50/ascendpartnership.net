      <a class="post-link" href="/2013/10/29/home-organization-tips-everyone-can-use/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Home Organization Tips Everyone Can Use</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>In a truly well organized home, everyone pitches in to keep things neat and tidy. If your home is feeling cluttered, or if cleaning day is stressing you out, here are some simple home organization tips that everyone can use.</p>

<p>To get started, you will need to determine how much time you want everyone to devote to cleaning each day, or do you want to dedicate a certain day of the week to cleaning instead?</p>

<p>Everything should have a place of its own and everything should be put away if it is not in use. While this can seem like a time consuming practice, it ends up saving you time in the long run.</p>

<p>Another important organizational step is to purge your home of as much clutter as possible. When there is no clutter it makes cleaning less stressful, and it takes less time to clean.</p>

<p>Another tip for people who live in two story houses is the “basket method.” There should be a basket for each room upstairs. In most homes, especially homes with children, a lot of the items that belong in bedrooms end up downstairs. Place the baskets somewhere at the base of the stairs. So when you find an object that belongs on the second floor, just put in the appropriate basket. Once the baskets are full, then bring them upstairs and put away everything.</p>

<p>Paper clutter is one of obstacles that every household deals with every single day. As soon as the mail arrives, or the children come home from school, or your partner comes home from work, they all have papers that need to be sorted. Where in your home does this pile start to grow? Maybe it’s the kitchen counter. The stack seems to use fertilizer because it grows so quickly right before your eyes. After a week, you can predict the pile is now 1-2 inches higher. The longer you wait to put every piece of paper in its location, the higher the pile grows, and pretty soon one pile quickly turn into two piles of paper.</p>

<p>Now you have an organizational nightmare with piles of paper. It would help to take notice where the pile of paper grows in your home and make it a priority to spend 30 minutes once a week, or 10 minutes each day sorting everything in the paper pile. Instead of looking at a pile of papers, try purchasing a low basket. Each day after you have gone through that day’s paper put it in the new paper basket.</p>

<p>There is paper clutter, and there is obvious regular, old clutter which is everywhere you turn your head. But with the right techniques, you can whip your home into shape and shave time off your cleaning routine. Make sure everything has a place and put it back every time you’re done with it. Storage containers will come into play with this type of organization. Clutter will require some form of storage that is appropriate for the clutter. The final task of organizing unattractive, old clutter is listing what is inside each container, so it will be easy for you to find what you need.</p>

<p>Sharing the chores is a terrific way to get the job done. Write to do list that outlines what chores must be completed each day of the week. Then decide if you are going to spend 10 minutes each day working on one of the tasks.</p>

<p>The other list method is very similar except that you spend 30 minutes each day working on one of the tasks. This is a win-win method of cleaning. Start by getting a blank card for each month of the year. Then write all the tasks that need to be completed within one of the days available. Place these monthly lists where the entire family can see them. That way each family member can take responsibility for a particular task. This gets the whole family working together to help make their home cleaner.</p>

<p>If you don’t take control of the clutter and organization of your home, you will find yourself in awkward situations. For example, let’s say you find out that you are going to have unexpected company stop by in 30 minutes. It is time to start hiding all your clutter, stress about cleaning the bathroom, stress about cleaning the kitchen and the room where you plan to visit. This is wasted cleaning time that could be better spent taking control of your home’s clutter and organizing each room. You will find that you enjoy home more, and you will be ready for company at a moment’s notice. A clean home is a happy home.</p>

  </header>

    <p>In response to demands for more nutritious snacks, there are a variety of so called health bars in our grocery store aisles. They range from fruit and nut, granola, Power Bars and cereal bars. According to the hype surrounding these bars, they are supposed to give quick energy without a sudden sugar crash and provide nutrient density. The question is, are they really any better than a candy bar or even simple carbs like white bread?</p>

<p>One study looked at the Power Bar which is geared for athletes. It is a high energy bar with a high ratio of complex to simple carbs. It produced a fast sugar peak about 30 minutes after eating and also showed a fast drop in sugar levels. It was faster than the candy bar or a piece of white bread. While it’s sugar performance was not desirable, the Power Bar is nutrient dense.</p>

<p>Most of the cereal health bars lack basic nutrition. Some are made of refined carbs with a sugary fruit mix in the middle. While their may be some vitamins and nutrients added, they are full of empty calories that will jack your blood sugar levels up and then down. Some granola or nut health bars are a step better. The granola nut base adds some fiber to the product which will slow the blood sugar rise and prevent an insulin response. Overall these products are primarily sugar based and have little to no protein and other nutrients.</p>

<p>The best heath food bars are probably found in the health food store. Here you can find mixes of different formulas of carbs, proteins and fats. A bar that is moderate in all three will regulate your insulin which is a fat storage hormone. It will also help keep you full longer.</p>

<p>For the most part, the health bars sold in the grocery store are not much better than candy or white bread. Most are too high in refined carbs and sugar, thus creating a surge in insulin which can promote fat gain. If you like energy bars visit a health food store and choose something with moderate levels of carbs, proteins and healthy fats.</p>

    <p>“Your ability to set goals is the master skill of success. Goals unlock your positive mind and release ideas and energy for goal attainment. Without goals, you simply drift and flow on the currents of life. With goals, you fly like an arrow, straight and true to your target.” Brian Tracey</p>

<p>Tips</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>While you are in this state write it down. Words are an integral part of the thinking process. Words convey images, pictures, feelings, emotions to the mind. By clothing it in words you allow the thought to take form in body, shape, form, substance. Try writing it in the form that you already have it, for example: “I am so happy that I am…” It may feel strange and silly to start but it help to put you into the right state.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get into this state as often as possible, including using techniques like visualization. Your subconscious mind doesn’t know the difference between something that is real and something vividly imagined. It is a secret technique to high achievers especially in sports. Whatever picture (goal) you consistently think about will drive your actions to create that exact picture. When you continually see yourself in possession of your goal, your subconscious mind will move you into actions that align with the mental image you hold.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Believe. If you don’t truly believe you can reach a goal, it will forever remain a pipe dream. In order to fully achieve anything, you must believe it is possible at a deep cellular level. For example if your goal is to achieve your ideal weight then buy the clothes now that you would wear when you are your ideal weight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have an attitude of gratitude. This will change you state from fear and disappointment to one of motivation. Be grateful for everything you have now. It may be the support of family and friends, or the ability to exercise. For an instant motivation shot please see this article and film… Strongest father in the world</p>
  </li>
</ol>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2013/10/03/manual-to-vegetarian-ideology/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Manual to Vegetarian Ideology</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>When someone says they are Vegetarians, we automatically think that they do not eat meat. While this is basically true, this is just a basic definition. Some eat fish but not meat, others eat eggs but not fish and this list is endless. There are many different kinds and levels of vegetarianism, and in this article, you will be able to read up on some of the more popular nutrition-diets and beliefs.</p>

<p>A) Vegans:</p>

<p>They do not consume any product that was derived from animals including, of course, any kind of meat, fish, dairy products, eggs as well as honey and foods that contain gelatin. Some vegans would not touch cane sugar, beer and wine since animal products involve in the finishing process: cane sugar is filtered with bone char and some beer and wines are clarified with egg white. As part of the vegan ideology, vegans would not consume products made of leather, furs, pearls, etc.</p>

<p>ii) Macrobiotics:</p>

<p>This diet started and spread out from the far east and Japan to be exact. According to this set of beliefs, there are particular rules and food items allowed. Since it is based on creating a balance between the two Japanese ideals: yang and yin, ingredients include different kinds if vegetables, fruits, whole grain, seeds and some Soya and nut derivatives. Fish is permissible.</p>

<p>C) Lacto-Ovos:</p>

<p>Based on the Latin word for milk and eggs, these vegetarians follow a simple rule. No meat, no fish, no poultry no sea-food but any and all kinds of egg and milk derivatives are allowed.</p>

<p>The lacto ovo vegetarian category is divided into two categories:</p>

<p>i) An Ovo Vegetarian does not eat meat and dairy products but does eat eggs.</p>

<p>ii) A Lacto Vegetarian does not eat meat and eggs but does eat dairy foods.</p>

<p>D) Raw Vegans:</p>

<p>Also called raw foodies limit themselves to unprocessed food that has not been heated above 115 degrees Fahrenheit or 46 degrees Celsius. Therefore, their diet mainly consists of raw vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds. However, some of the raw foodies do consist raw food that was derived from animals in their diet including raw eggs, unheated dairy products and sushi.</p>

<p>E) Pescetarians:</p>

<p>The pescatarian or pescetarian (depending on how you spell it) are those who refrain from consuming meat but will take in shellfish, sea food and fish. This group of vegetarians are less formed from those who have become vegetarians because of ideology and more from those who are forced to follow such a diet due to health problems. Others also rationalize that the killing of fish is much less crueler than the killing of animals or that fish are not as intelligent as animals grown on a farm.</p>

<p>Dedicated vegetarians would put the pescatarian under the category of semi vegetarians. In the same category you can find the pollo vegetarians who will include poultry in their diet, the flexitarianism who will avoid eating meat that derived from an animal that was brought up and died in cruel conditions. The flexitarianism are similar to the freeganism that would not mind eating any type of meat unless any part of its process involved environmental damage or human or animals exploitation.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Fruit trees seem sturdy once full grown, but nature has insured ways to keep them alive in forests and wild unexplored regions. Nobody knows how many perished due to the absence of necessary requirements to grow properly. Artificially grown fruit trees do need proper care and effective rearing to maximize its producing capabilities. The health of the fruits they bore is the by-products of the methods employed in the growth process.</p>

<p>Fruit trees can guarantee lifelong generosity by bearing fruits. Farmers can make the most out of acres of land with well-grown assets that continuously produce satisfactory quantities. Taking care of plantations of greeneries like fruit trees are unimaginably fulfilling in real sense.</p>

<p>Because of its long phase of growth, when properly managed, it could be turned over to the next generation without assuming loss other than careless mishandling and lack of general knowledge on how to expand the planting techniques. With the asset growing from land, there is assurance of contributing to the preservation of mother earth, if one is giving thought to the idealism of planting and caring for fruit trees. Is there really a proper science to it? How can one make the best move in maintaining the longevity of acres of land planted with fruit trees?</p>

<p>Consider the following seasonal factors:</p>

<p>Specialty:</p>

<p>Focus is all about mastering a crop. Are you planting just one kind of fruit, or are you planting similar species with specific management techniques? This is up for the farmer’s passion for a certain kind of tree. It will depend on what has been practiced in the rearing process and when harvesting. Each crop varies in approach of growth, distance, need for pruning, draining of excess water during harsh rainy season and adjustment to its soil in general.</p>

<p>Weather:</p>

<p>Convenience of raising trees has to be adjusted to the location’s weather. Is your land in a tropical climate or in a frigid climate? Some selected breeds must be grown right after winter. Avocado and cherries are some of the delicate fruit trees, which have to be planted right after the last hint of frost is seen. The same way with specializing a crop, some fruit trees are simply not for any kind of weather. Some have to grow in cold countries while others only grow in tropical or temperate climates.</p>

<p>Fertilizers:</p>

<p>As part of maintenance and proper care, fertilizers have to be organic. It is an essential aspect of keeping fruit trees from plant disease and other parasitic infiltration to avoid affecting the quality of fruit production. Young trees need the most amounts of fertilizers than the grown ones.</p>

<p>Pruning</p>

<p>Not all fruits need pruning. Seminars on proper way of pruning vary from different fruit trees. A good reference should be followed to know the proper way and the dimensions of trimming needed to do the task. Generally new bare roots have to be planted to the ground at once before drying and they require instant pruning prior to the planting. The rest of the fruit trees have to be watched over for maintenance pruning like when there are excess branches reaching the ground or when it is really time to prune anyway.</p>

<p>Just like a vocation, some people have chosen the path as a fruit tree farmer. It is an undertaking closest to nature, fresh, fulfilling and lasting.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2013/09/16/the-meaning-of-life/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">The Meaning of Life</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Modern medical science in our society has risen to an almost god-like status among us. We are running to the doctor at any sign of physical or mental discomfort. Relinquishing all responsibility for our healing to the medical system. It seems that this practice by all accounts is stretching the traditional health care system to the point of breaking.</p>

<p>To view healing from a totally different perspective putting the power back to the individual where I believe it belongs. Instead of treating an imbalance with pills or surgery at disease from a belief that these conditions are presented to us for the reason of attaining mastery of the primary life lesson and is a necessary part of life. In explaining this healing modality the lofty question of the meaning of life is answered in such a way as it all fits together.</p>

<p>As previously stated, I believe that this total shift of perspective from giving our power away to doctors or healers of any kind to one of taking personal responsibility for ourselves in all aspects of life is happening right now.</p>

<p>I like to believe that deep down we feel that relying on the medical system to solve our mental</p>

<p>and physical conditions is inherently unnatural giving impetus to the ever increasing use of alternative healing modalities that give us back the power and subsequently the responsibility for our own healing.</p>

<p>Being a facilitator comes with a set of parameters to follow that are a necessary part for anyone who practices or any other alternative healing.</p>

<p>These 12 suggestions allow facilitators to keep balanced while creating space for others to heal themselves.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Healing can only take place with each person holding their own power. The first and most important concern is to find ways to facilitate others without taking their power from them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All facilitation must be by request. It is not possible to facilitate healing without their specific request.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only possible to facilitate healing with the highest intent. There is no secrets. and must allow our intentions to be fully seen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As healers we understand that illness is not always a sign that something is wrong. Illness sometimes facilitates change and is only one state of health.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to always speak our truth but in doing so know that truth is always a work in progress. We have to leave room for growth in the words we speak. We must honor all flavors of the truth no matter how different they seem from our own. Allowing other people to stand in their truth without being threatened by ours. Competition is an illusion of separateness that is no longer valid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must check our egos often and examine truthfully the motivations for our words and actions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must practice the art of discernment in making choices without judgment and only choose what things and ideas that nurture us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not be afraid to say “I don’t know”. Make space for empowerment of all and that none of us has all the answers but together, all of us has access to all the answers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Know that the true strength of a healer lies in our vulnerability. If we share our mistakes openly then our perceived weaknesses will become our greatest strengths.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must remember that we have no control over the thoughts that come into our head but have complete control over what stays there. Take responsibility for becoming the master of our thoughts and share the process with others around us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Know that we all have the same base motivation. We are all looking for answers to the major life questions and remember that the easiest way to do that is to do it together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Know that it is not possible to heal another. It is only possible to offer them the space in which to heal themselves, if they choose. We will not take responsibility for the healing of anyone but our self. Responsibility is the balance of power.We help people to take responsibility for their own healing so that they may hold their true power.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These suggestions were designed for facilitators but I believe they can hold for anyone who’s purpose is to facilitate healing of others. This is the future of healing in what I call the new planet earth.</p>

<p>I hope that if you read all 5 parts of this series that all or even one sentence rang true for you and you could relate the information to something that you have experienced in your life. My intent with writing this was to offer an alternative for people who believe that there is more to this human experience than just getting by or enduring everyday life with that empty sentiment of “Is this all there is?”</p>

<p>So, this is the conclusion of the series. In explaining the perspective I hope I have answered all the questions that I asked when we began this journey into an explanation of the meaning of life.</p>

<p>I truly believe the concept that we are not just human beings wrestling with the idea of spirituality but, in fact, we are spiritual beings coping with the process of a human awakening. This concept give us the knowledge that there are higher truths about life waiting for us to discover. Now that, to me, is reason enough to celebrate and enjoy every second of it for this is this is the real reason we are here. This is the true meaning of life!</p>
