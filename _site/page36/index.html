  </header>

    <p>Bird watching is a fantastic hobby suitable for individuals of all ages. In addition to enjoying the great outdoors and gaining an appreciation for nature, bird watching is a hobby that can be shared with friends and family. Many bird watchers find themselves healthier due to their time outside scanning the skies for that ultra-rare bird. If you are interested in beginning bird watching as a hobby, consider the following tips to get your started and on the right track.</p>

<p>Get a book.</p>

<p>Most bird watchers are not experts on our fine feathered friends from the start. Instead of thinking, a bird is a bird is a bird, think again! Birds are a fabulous species that are as diverse as any other set of creatures on this earth. Furthermore, most birds are readily identified by their coloration, so choose a book that has many color pictures suitable for matching the bird in the sky with the correct one in the book. Bird books are available for all different types of bird watchers, from children to adults interested in learning more about birds that the color of their feathers. Also, consider choosing a book with information about bird tracks, since you will be able to determine what types of birds are in the area by the tracks they make.</p>

<p>Listen to the music.</p>

<p>Even if you cannot see the bird, you will be able to identify the bird through its song. In order to be able to correctly identify birds by sound, consider investing in a CD of bird songs. These are readily available for every budget, just be sure to choose a CD that identifies the species of bird that is doing the singing. Consider involving the entire family in learning how to identify birds by their songs, as these CDs are excellent ways to keep the whole family entertained on long car trips.</p>

<p>Join a club.</p>

<p>The old saying, “birds of a feather flock together” also applies to bird watchers. There are groups all over the country—and the world where bird watchers join to socialize and converse about the different birds they have seen. If you are a new bird watcher, these groups will be great in getting you into the hobby, since most bird watchers have already learned how to identify birds by both sight and sound. Furthermore, bird watching clubs have a great deal of fun by organizing unique activities that incorporate their favorite hobby.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2010/12/19/steps-to-catch-a-shark-from-the-beach/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Steps To Catch A Shark From The Beach</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Fishing is something that many people consider a process of luck and chance. For example, the average gentleman who approaches the local waterway on a Sunday afternoon has a chance of catching a specimen. But does his lonely prawn – sitting in front of an over-sized sinker, slowly drifting downstream – set a scene for a positive or negative chance of a capture?</p>

<p>I firmly believe that fishing should be approached with a goal and the necessary knowledge and skills in order to maximize success. The fisherman who envisions an eighty-two centimeter Flathead (goal) and visits a sandy bank on sunset accompanied by a run-out tide and the correct outfit, is significantly increasing the chances of achieving his goal.</p>

<p>Land Based Shark Fishing (LBSF) can only be successful when skill is relied on, much like the gentleman targeting an over sized flat-head. Certainly, someone who views capturing a big shark as chance or luck will never be successful. Catching a large specimen from the beach requires consideration of the strategic key points that follow.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Choosing the right bait is a large part of this operation and after many years of testing different specimens the local eel and ray populations have produced outstanding results. These baits last in the water for over twenty-four hours and are gorged on by big hungry sharks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tide times and moon phases are a primary consideration for LBSF and fishing time must be optimized around certain strategic points. For most sharks, fishing a run-out tide on a new moon will almost guarantee results. Some of our local crew have predicted strikes within thirty seconds of a low tide change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rigs must be made with large ‘J’-style hooks (14O – 16O) and crimped onto insulated wire, as micro voltages generated from bare cable and salt water consistently deter potential customers. Taped coat hanger wire can quickly be converted to a three-prong anchor that should be bound to the cable to secure the bait to the seabed, minimizing drift. Furthermore, cable or electrical ties are the ultimate devices for securing a large eel or ray to a rig for optimal bait presentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right equipment is essential even though it may be a large investment. Penn international 50 or 80 size reels or similar Shimano Tiagra set-ups work brilliantly. Spooling these units with 80 to 100 pound lines and mounting them on 24 or 37kg rods will usually convince most large sharks to turn their head toward the beach. Black Magic belts and Braid harness set-ups are also critical when a strike is converted to a battle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using an inflatable craft powered by a small outboard should be enough for bait deployment. Environments such as Moreton Island in Queensland, Australia offer a sharp drop off which means bait can be confidentially dispatched into deep water. Deploying baits just over drop-offs or in three to ten meters of water often produce good results. Remember that deploying baits near the horizon only reduces the amount of line you have to control a specimen.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So are you still pondering whether catching a specimen is simply chance? Well, once you consider the intimacy of this procedure, and understand that serious knowledge and skill is involved, you’re ready to start. Don’t be discouraged if your initial attempts are not successful – simply try different locations until you get a strike. Following the above recipe will improve your strike rate incredibly and in a short time you will be predicting your next encounters.</p>

<p>May the hub of your reel be seen regularly!</p>
