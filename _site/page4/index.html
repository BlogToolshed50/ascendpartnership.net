  </header>

    <p>The first few years of a child’s life are full of new and exciting experiences that are absorbed like a sponge through the five senses: touch, taste, smell, sight and sound. From birth, newborns are bombarded with a busy world that they must learn to master. It is the senses that pave the way for a child’s development throughout his or her life.</p>

<p>“From birth, parents must choose toys and learning tools for their child that are fun and enjoyable to play with and that also foster senatorial growth to ensure a more complete development process,” says Dr. Kathleen Alfano, leading child Researcher and Director of the Fisher-Price Child Research Department.</p>

<p>A baby can start to develop hand-eye coordination, watch moving objects and be able to distinguish color and form within the first few months. Toys that will help develop these skills include the Peek-A-Blocks line from Fisher-Price – a creative and fun alternative to classic building blocks. Different series of these clear, stack-able blocks are filled with everything from cute animals to fun shapes and foster the development of different senses. Touch Sensations blocks are made of different textures for baby to explore and Sound Sensations include blocks that ring and squeak.</p>

<p>Finding toys that will stimulate a few senses at a time are also helpful in sensory development, as a child will have to learn that in most situations, combining senses are crucial to perception. The Winnie The Pooh 1, 2, 3 Exploring Tree from Fisher-Price will keep a baby engaged and captivated from the time he/she can sit up to the time he/she can stand. Along the base, basic infant activities nurture hand-eye coordination, while Winnie The Pooh sits atop the tree among a flurry of soft, bright butterflies.</p>

<p>Introducing a baby to sounds, bright colors and action-based toys will make playtime more fun and enjoyable and is a good way to enhance a child’s creative abilities and imagination from an early age, teaching him/her to unlock the wonder and excitement of the world around them by simply making “sense” of it.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Budget Your Money. Even if you are living paycheck to paycheck like most of us, knowing how much money goes to where can be a big help. This gives you the relief that the bills are being paid, with a feel of how much you can spend on allowance, school photos, birthday gifts, entertainment or just You!</p>

<p>Keep a Daily Schedule. Time is important, so teach that to the kids by implementing a routine. Put together a schedule reflecting chore &amp; homework time. If the kids know their daily routine then it gives them something fun to work for when the Room is clean or the garbage is taken out. Don’t be afraid to make your own chores so that your children see you set a positive example.</p>

<p>Let Your Kids be Kids. Even though taking on Single Parenting has sometimes forced you to become serious and lacking laughter, remember those precious children never asked to be in this situation. Don’t force them to grow up any faster and deal with the ‘Single Parent Issues’ that we have to deal with. They are still kids and they shouldn’t have to worry about anything other than Kid Issues.</p>

<p>Stay Positive about the Other Parent. No matter the circumstances, don’t down talk the other parent. If the Other Parent isn’t paying child support, it’s none of the kids business and shouldn’t be something that is talked about if not brought up by the child. Whether the parent is around or away, it shouldn’t matter. We once saw good in that person and regardless of how it is now, your child may always think the world of that Other Parent. In time the truth always comes out, and the only way a child will know is discovering for themselves.</p>

<p>Communicate to Your Children About the Special Circumstances of Your Family. You can keep your kids informed without telling them everything. If you talk to your kids early on, when they are ready, you can avoid having them learn from a distant relative, some other child from school or even a stranger.</p>

<p>Spend Quality Time with Your Children. Keeping your family going takes a lot of energy and a good amount of Quality time away from the kids. Set out a time each day to read, play a game, play on the computer or even learn something new. It could be 2 hours or 20 minutes. What matters is that your child know it’s his/her time and they will look forward to each and every day.</p>

<p>Find Support and Use it. There is a lot of help out there, including the resources in this newsletter. Take advantage of them. They’re there for you to utilize. I always keep in mind that one day soon I won’t need them and I can turn around and help others in the same situation.</p>

<p>Take Time for Yourself. You may always have your children around, but don’t forget you are still one person. Keep yourself healthy and feeling positive about being a parent. I know it gets tough and you feel like you are all alone, but you’re not. Take some time out to spend with yourself or even to hang out with friends. Adult conversation and a movie is always nice after a long Saturday of nonstop giggling and cartoons!</p>

  </header>

    <p>In most cases insect bites are harmless and if left alone, the irritation will subside within 48 hours.</p>

<p>However, for some people, particularly children, scratching bites may lead to a highly contagious bacterial skin infection called impetigo. Left unchecked, impetigo can spread to other parts of the body and even from person to person.</p>

<p>As a family physician, I recommend the following tips to ensure you and your family maximize your summer fun and avoid this irritating skin disease:</p>

<p># Apply an effective insect repellent as directed. As an alternative to chemical-based repellents, I recommend citronella-based products, particularly for young children.</p>

<p># Avoid scratching. To calm the itching, traditional products such as calamine lotion may be useful. I also recommend my patients use after bite, a product designed to neutralize the allergens that cause the itch.</p>

<p># Keep fingernails short and clean. The bacteria streptococcal, which causes impetigo, hides under fingernails and enters the body when scratching the bite. Children are more vulnerable to this disease because streptococcal is often found in sand piles where kids play.</p>

<p># Recognize the symptoms. Impetigo is characterized by a red bump on the skin where yellow pus accumulates and dries, leaving a scab that can be itchy.</p>

<p># Protect the infection. Impetigo spreads easily through direct body contact, sharing towels, bedding and clothes. Although it is not a serious disease, it needs immediate attention to stop it from spreading.</p>

<p># Seek treatment. The best way to avoid impetigo is to treat a bug bite as soon as possible. Should impetigo develop, oral antibiotics and antibiotic creams may be required as prescribed by your doctor.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Is daylight-saving time wreaking havoc in your home? Is it difficult to get your infant to sleep in? Do your kids keep informing you “It can’t be bed time, the sun is still out”? How about when the summer ends and it is time to get your children back onto a school schedule? Let’s face it, just because the calendar says September, that does not mean that the sun no longer shines through the bedroom windows.</p>

<p>If any of these situations sound familiar then you will be relieved to know about room-darkening window shades. Shade is a pleated window shade made of heavy-duty paper that hangs quickly and effortlessly using a peel and stick strip. Weary parents can turn to room-darkening shades to cover children’s windows easily and keep the sun from shining in their rooms, preventing sleep.</p>

<p>“Parents have wrestled for years to get their babies or small children to sleep when the sun blazes into their bedrooms. Now with room-darkening Shades, keeping the bright light out of rooms is a snap. Originally conceived as a temporary solution to covering bare windows, parents can now provide a dark and calming atmosphere to bedrooms at minimal cost. Whether you have children or a day sleeper in your home, these room-darkening shades provide a tranquil environment,”</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2014/10/29/the-professions-of-the-future/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">The Professions of the Future</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Predicting the future is a tricky business. There have been countless ridiculous failures at identifying the trends and products which will determine the future shape of our life and our environment. Even more difficult is trying to guess which of us will be deemed a useful member of the community – and which an obsolete relic. To a large extent, the answer to this question lies in determining the useful professions of the future. This is an age when people are determined, defined and categorized in strict accordance with their professions. Whereas during the Renaissance, a person might have been defined by his range of interests (remember the likes of Leonardo da Vinci), by his familial, religious, or ethnic affiliations, by his or her gender and so on – today the first and foremost question is a person’s profession. The first question that we must provide a clear answer to is: What constitutes a profession (as opposed to a hobby), a vocation (as opposed to an avocation)? To qualify as a profession, the act must bear the following hallmarks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It must be continuous and pursued for a long time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must occupy most of the waking hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must yield earnings or compensation whether in money or in kind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The person must have an advantage in that field of knowledge or activity, at least over laymen. In other words, the categories of laymen and expert – which are the result of highly specific education – must exist and prevail.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be hierarchically layered with clear flows of professional authorities and responsibilities and with a clear career path (progressing up the professional ladder).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The second relevant question is: What are the trends which determine our future? It is useless to look at microtrends. These are too volatile and, in principle, unpredictable. Much more important are the trends that last for hundreds or even thousands of years. These are usually not the results of technological conjuncture or geopolitical upheavals. Rather, they are the outcomes of characteristic human activities which are uninterrupted. Healthcare, for instance, is such a human activity. Humans – terrified of death and infirmity – always wanted and are very likely to continue to want to improve their health and thus to postpone the inevitable and better the quality of what is available. Another such overriding tendency is education: this is a part of the human survival kit. By educating oneself, by studying a profession, by learning more about the world – one better one’s chances to survive. Out of this set of human, almost deterministic activities, a group of overriding trends emerges:</p>

<p>From Less Mobility to More Mobility</p>

<p>People, goods and, lately, information became and become, daily, more and more mobile. Physical distance has been shrunk. A global marketplace has formed. Information is almost instantly available anywhere. This was described as the global village – an outdated concept which might soon be replaced by the global home. All the professions which has to do with more mobility will benefit and represent preferred professions of the future. The moving of people: pilots, drivers, the car industry, sophisticated traffic planners and automotive innovators, tourism related professions and so on. The moving of goods: shipping, trucking, air and modern train travel. This area is already so specialized that I do not consider it as offering opportunities in the future (put differently, I do not regard it as a growth industry). The moving of information (today dubbed: “The Service Industries”): Trading systems, the Internet, Networking and communications related professions, the field of communications within the computer industries, telecommunications, entertainment related professions, technologies of banking. The creation of destinations for people, goods and information (commonly known as Markets or Marketplaces): advertising, marketing, trading, design, image and public relations experts.</p>

<p>The Age Polarization of Society</p>

<p>Better medicine will lead to a polarization of the age structure of society: there will be more older people and more younger people. Gradually, as birth rates fall and contraception becomes widespread, a reverse pyramid will be formed: most people will be middle aged and old. This offers a clear view of professions which will be required in the future: Professionals to take care of older and younger people (which have very similar needs): nurses, paramedics, nannies, entertainers, leisure time professionals, companions, specialized equipment manufacturers, operators of homes for the very old or for the very young, pension planners, manufacturers of specialized medical and paramedical needs and products for both age groups, legal and accounting specialists in pension and inheritance laws and tax planning. Virtually every industry and field of human activity will have to adapt themselves to these demographic changes. Age-related expertise will develop in each one of them. This applies to the arts (mainly music and cinema) as well as to the crafts, to industry as well as to agriculture, to infrastructure as well as to government. Human society will be enormously influenced by these shifts.</p>

<p>The Fragmentation of Society</p>

<p>Initially, society was composed of very large units. People belonged to tribes “nations”. These were groupings of up to hundreds of thousands of people. They felt amply defined by this belonging. Nothing was left out when you said that a certain person was “Hebrew”. Nothing needed to be added. Stereotypes were more than sufficient and, usually accurate.</p>

<p>Later, the concept of family fully emerged. First, in a very extended form: the family comprised a few generations and all removed family (blood) connections. Gradually, the family shed more and more layers. People began to be called by family names only 250 years ago. The nuclear family was an invention of the 19th century, when the industrial revolution and modern methods of transport and communication broke families apart. Even this relatively small units came under a debilitating attack in the last 50 years and the nuclear family underwent a nuclear implosion, it disintegrated. Today, the basic unit of society, its cell, its atom, is the individual.</p>

<p>People will tend to isolate themselves: stay more at home, work from it with flextime, form and break up short term attachments to other humans or be engaged in non-committal activities with others, activities which will not threaten their absolute freedom and mobility. Solitary media will be predominant: the Internet is a one-user medium (television was a family medium).</p>

<p>The professions which will cater to the needs of individuals and separate them from society (while maintaining the survival need to communicate) will be the professions of the future: Internet, entertainment (especially customized), telecommunication, singles-related industries (dating and couple matching, for instance, single’s bars, to mention another), virtual reality, small businesses which can be run from home, agencies for temporary work placement and other professions catering to the conflicting human needs of being together while being alone.</p>

<p>All the other seeming trends are recurrent illusions. Thee have been ages of more or less democracy, more or less market orientation, more or less polarization between rich and poor people. The human race experienced numerous forms of government, of marriage, of economy, of management, of residence, of production, even of trying to predict the future. It was the wisest of all men, King Solomon, who said: “There is nothing new under the sun”. True, but it is getting stronger.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Internet fraud should be addressed as two specific issues: fraud that uses Internet technology as an integral part of the fraud; fraud that is already taking place by other means and the Internet is merely another method of delivery.</p>

<p>Methods exist that stop fraudsters misusing the technology, which can be rapidly implemented, but factors such as industry acceptance and concerns over potential liability if previous security claims could be claimed to be inaccurate will delay introduction. Much effort is spent promoting logos and confusing self-regulation, and trying to catch fraudsters, whilst the adoption of formal standards and accreditation for security (such as ISO 17799) are only starting to take place.</p>

<p>New Internet environment crimes may exist, such as defrauding machines or causing business harm by denial of service or virus attacks, and these will require social and legal steps to address them. However, the Internet has provided the fraudster with access to a significantly bigger market than ever before and effort will be required to create an environment where fraud is resisted by design rather than by insurance.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>

<p>Internet fraud is said to be big business. But what is it, and does using the Internet create the fraud, or is the Internet just a different way of delivering ‘traditional’ fraud.</p>

<p>Fraud is essentially persuading someone of something with intent to deceive, perhaps with criminal intent. The deceit may be to persuade you to part with money, goods, services, rights or information.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this paper we are not going to examine methods of fraud, but look at the general techniques, how they are applied, and how, if at all, the Internet can be used to make those techniques easier for the criminal to use either to carry out a fraud or to escape detection.</p>

<p>General techniques of fraud</p>

<p>The key to fraud is to persuade you that something is real, when in fact it is not. Once you accept that the fake is real then the fraud can take place – whatever it is. Whether you are buying the Eiffel Tower in Paris or the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco (both are real and have been seen by millions of people – and have been regularly ‘sold’) the essence is to believe the proposal that is put to you.</p>

<p>Other types of fraud essentially persuade you to do something in the (wrong) belief that it should be done, or to accept something in settlement that proves to be without the value you were led to believe. But they all come back to the same thing – the fraudster has to persuade you that his vision of the world is the correct one.</p>

<p>How do we normally counter fraud</p>

<p>In ordinary life there are many things set up to help avoid fraud. Mostly we rely upon physical things – buildings (such as banks) help to prove to us that we are dealing with something real – talking to people on the telephone on a number that is in a directory helps us believe that they are who we expect. At a more sophisticated level, businesses have to be registered and the directors names and addresses made public. There are also agencies with a duty to respond to complaints over the trading practices of businesses.</p>

<p>How does the Internet map to the real world</p>

<p>The Internet is rather different. The biggest problem for the Internet user is that there is no physical reference to use. You have to believe what the computer tells you, and that is the start of the problems.</p>

<p>We have many practical examples where people get the physical world wrong – they put their bank cards into fake ATMs and enter their PINs, they tell their friends and children their passwords (sometimes in public), they sign up to ‘get rich quick’ deals with people they don’t know – so how well are we set up to handle the Internet world, where web sites are just exactly as good as their designer intended?</p>

<p>The practical answer is just barely. The Internet is marketed as an anonymous zone. Information is free and users are anonymous. Now some of those features are desirable. When you go into a store it is the store that has to tell you who they are. If you pay with cash they will never know who you are and none of your legal rights are affected. They give you a receipt and you can check any of the details and get corrections made on the spot. If you want credit you have to tell them more about you, but not necessarily very much.</p>

<p>The Internet, by comparison, is anonymous whether you are the seller or the customer. For the seller it is as anonymous as they want to make it. This, of course, might be thought of as attractive to a fraudster.</p>
