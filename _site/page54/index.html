  </header>

    <p>Through time, as you grow old, you will encounter many health problems that can be countered by leading a healthy lifestyle. This will also be beneficial in the goal to better your memory. In psychology, this is defined as one’s mental ability to encode the registered information, retain and use the helpful data whenever necessary.</p>

<p>You must do everything necessary to keep your brain functioning well. This way, you can avoid getting numerous disorders that are associated with the brain. As people grow old, the one aspect that usually gets affected is their memory. They are having difficult time remembering valuable information, especially at times when they need to come up with an answer. The following processes of how your brain functions get affected, especially when you just let it be and you don’t act upon the problem.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Encoding. When your brain receives information, it processes everything and combines pieces of what has been received with the data already stored in your system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Storage. Your brain acts like the hard disk of your system where you store everything. But unlike the computer system, your brain records the information permanently. And it will stay there for as long as you are healthy and you haven’t encountered serious problems that have caused your brain to malfunction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recall. In cases wherein you have to answer questions and situations based on what has already been stored in your brain, you try to recall the data that may help you arrive at the right conclusions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

  </header>

    <p>The article written by Landon Gilbert</p>

<p>I know it might not seem like the most obvious “best movie for a date night”, but for me and the boyfriend, it is all about LA Confidential. On our very first date, we decided to ditch going to a high paying restaurant and go back to my apartment and watch some of the best hd tv service. I made some spaghetti while he put got to choose a movie.</p>

<p>Suffice to say, we ended up watching this great neo-noir crime drama starring Russel Crow and Guy Pearce. It is a pretty gritty affair with lots of shooting and punching. Of course, it isn’t entirely without heart: Crow falls for a classic “hooker with a heart of gold” played by Kim Bassinger, who earned an Academy Award for her work. No one</p>

<p>In the midst of all the crime solving and political intrigue, the two of us shared our very first kiss. Two years later, we’re still together and when we want to sit down and remember good times, we’ll still watch LA Confidential. Unlike Crowe and Bassinger, we didn’t need a murder investigation to make it work.</p>
