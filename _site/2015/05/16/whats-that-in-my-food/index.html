    <p>If you drop a crackers, you hurt not only your enemies but your friends as well. This is the effect food additives have on humans.</p>

<p>Man has existed for thousands of years, and only started using additives at the start of the industrial revolution, when women were set free. Most animals eat their food when and where it is grown. Not humans. Man, because of his concentrated urban areas, was forced to ship and process his food.</p>

<p>Food additives are any substances added to food which may have some “useful” purpose, such as protection from deterioration or spoilage.</p>

<p>Additives are also used to improve taste, flavor, texture, and appearance to restore nutritive value and to aide in processing and packaging. There are at least 704 additives used in the processing of our food.</p>

<p>According to the Food and Drug Administration, manufacturers have to prove that the additives are necessary.</p>

<p>Additives kill bacteria of all living organisms in the food, so there is no decay. There is nothing to prevent them from harming body enzymes and organs.</p>

<p>Milk is a good example. Calcium chloride is added to canned and evaporated milk. It is also used to melt snow and causes metal parts to disintegrate. Milk substitutes contain an array of acids and gases.</p>

<p>Choose your bread carefully. It takes five times the chemicals to make whole wheat bread than white bread.</p>

<p>Sugar is pumped so full of acids, then boiled several times, which makes it the deadest and most dangerous product on the market. Meat has about 13 different additives, ranging from dyes to acids to buffers.</p>

<p>Then to find out what’s in your food-read labels and check with the FDA.</p>
