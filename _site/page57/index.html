  </header>

    <p>Being forgetful about little things isn’t a good sign of leading a healthy mind or good memory. These things are important in terms of allowing your mind to create its own association with the things in the past that you have been used to and the just the thought of you being on this state creates an even bigger conflict with upcoming tasks.</p>

<p>But let us not forget the people with commendable memory. They may have nothing in particular to worry about especially when it comes to memorization tasks, but these people still and will experience a slip of thought time and again. It may be just little things, like saying you have misplaced your keys because you have forgotten where you last put it in the first place. For you it may just be a simple “misplacement” of important objects, but if you try to think about it at a different level, it is actually a memory problem. The bad news is that, it could even become worse than how it is today.</p>

<p>Again, these things may be simple. Other than forgetting where you have placed your car keys this morning, things like important events and deadlines can slip off of your mind as well and this could become a bad habit. Good news is, you can take control of these things. You can stop yourself from developing absentmindedness because when it takes over you, your natural instinct of organizing things properly also slips away.</p>

<p>When you try to think about it, there is actually a great significance as to how a person organize his thoughts and in turn, the things that matters around him. Improving your memory can be done in so many ways but destroying it can also happen in a snap and there are still more factors that contribute to memory failure.</p>

<p>This time, it’s simple. Try your best to be organized. If remembering where you placed your car keys is a problem, use a container you can easily spot and place it where it can easily be seen. If remembering names is too much, ask more information about the person, his whereabouts, achievements and acquaintances. The things that he say are going to imprint memory anchors to your brain which holds on to his name. There are many ideas how you can simply prevent forgetfulness but it is up to you apply it.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Guest post written by Al Hartford</p>

<p>When I saw the commercials for Avatar, I couldn’t wait for it to come on my favorite channel HBO. In 2009, Avatar took us to a world of spectacular imagination, when a recalcitrant hero started off on an epic adventure. Fighting to save this world he has just begun to call home, Jake must battle not only epic and dangerous creatures, but his own comrades in order to save his new home, the only place he has felt comfortable since he took on the Avatar suit.</p>

<p>Oscar award-winning director of the epic film Titanic, James Cameron first thought up the plot for this movie 15 years ago. Unable to do it then, he has finally seen his dream of Avatar come true.</p>

<p>Now we are brought into a world of strange creatures, epic heros, and beauty beyond imagining. With Sam Worthington as Jake the Avatar, he gets quite lost in the world of the Na’vi, with just Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) as his guide through the Na’vi’s spectacular, awesomely gorgeous world.</p>

<p>This movie blew me away. Avatar brought me into a beautiful, danger-filled world, filling me with love and admiration for its inhabitants. The world of the Na’vi is simply gorgeous, with strange creatures and beauty at every turn. I could not get enough of this world, just staring transfixed at every new beauteous creature, every gorgeous piece of landscape that popped up. This movie was one of my favorites simply for the beautiful landscape, much less the plot and characters.</p>

<p>I watch movies on HBO on satellite t.v. all the time. Avatar had me glued to the screen from the first moment, and I could not look away. Avatar has become one of my all-time favorite movies from www.TVByDirect.com, where I purchased by Satellite tv service.</p>

<p>Besides movies, I like series as well. I love True Blood, the action is really cool, way better than those cheesy vampire movies out now. I also can’t wait for Steve Buscemi’s new series too.</p>

  </header>

    <p>This was written by guest blogger Jermain Wesley</p>

<p>My favorite show on a premium channel is Weeds on Showtime. This show has suspense, drama, action, romance, and comedy, making it the perfect viewing experience. The characters in the show are fun and exciting, and the same goes with the story line.</p>

<p>This show is about a mother of two kids who has suddenly become a widow. Her husband had always provided everything that she and the children needed, so she is not sure how to survive. Instead of going out and getting a real job to pay the bills, she begins to sell weed. She soon has a thriving business going with the help of her pot smoking friends. It isn’t all smooth sailing though, there are many bumps and bruises along the way.</p>

<p>Watching Weeds via free satellite tv in Pennsylvania is awesome, and I love seeing every new show each week. I never know what might happen next because there are so many twists and turns that they keep you on the edge of your seat. When I feel like watching a good show, I turn to Showtime and watch Weeds.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Knowing yourself and feeling confident about yourself helps a lot in finding your passion at work. This begins with accurate understanding of your strengths and values – it’s what makes you feel good about yourself. The process starts by evaluating the factors that molded your personality – family, experiences, education, and trainings. Majority of your strengths and values can be determined even at young age. Some are product of your parents’ upbringing while some are product of unfulfilled needs you try to reinforce as you grow mature. Knowing your top top-five strengths and values gives you a template by which you measure choices in your career and personal life. Being successful at work means you can freely use all of these strengths as well as fulfill your values.</p>

<p>When your act is not reflected with your strengths and values, what do you feel? Useless and powerless? You fail when you find yourself in a work that tells so little about your values, your thought and feelings. When you are in this kind of situation, you feel tied up in a routine that is too far from your own personality. You will usually feel bored and unfulfilled. You don’t look forward to exciting and adventurous days. You feel trapped and always wish for vacations, day-offs and lunch breaks. Regardless of how much money you make, when you deny your thoughts and feelings – your work is difficult and boring.</p>

<p>The best time to determine your strengths and values are when you are honest and direct. By accepting your feelings you reveal so much of your potentials and possibilities in life. It is also important to become proud of yourself. Some people hide their true strengths out of fear of rejection. Your power lies in your uniqueness and powerful people are confident about their self even if it’s about negative or positive one. To find your passion at work you must resist the urge of comparing yourself to others as it limits your choices and career development.</p>
