  </header>

    <p>Although only small amounts of the mineral copper are needed to stay healthy, copper still has an important role in many of the body’s functions. Even a small copper deficiency can begin to cause health problems. When you take in the right amount of copper every day, your health will improve in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>Copper plays a vital role in bone health. Studies have shown that those who take in a good amount of copper experience less bone density loss, which decreases the occurrence of osteoporosis. Copper can also help regulate the levels of good and bad cholesterol in the body, which means it can improve and maintain the health of your heart. Copper is a component of melanin, which pigments the skin, hair, and eyes. Because of this, proper levels of copper can prevent and even reverse many discoloration problems in these areas. Copper also influences the production of collagen and helps keep the skin looking supple. Copper also has anti-inflammatory properties, which is extremely beneficial to those with arthritis and joint pain. Copper also aids in the absorption of iron, which helps to balance hemoglobin levels.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that copper is only required in very small amounts. Those who consume moderate amounts of seafood, beans, and leafy greens, and those who drink water that flows through copper pipes or those who use copper cookware probably do not require a copper supplement. Because the mineral zinc can inhibit copper absorption, most supplements containing zinc also contain a small dose of copper. In high doses, copper can actually be very toxic. For these reasons, most people do not need to take a copper supplement in addition to their daily diets and supplements. However, those who are working to improve the conditions of their heart, bone, or joint health will want to talk to their doctor to see if a copper supplement might be right for them.</p>

  </header>

    <p>One should know that the mineral is a natural occurring solid who’s formation occurs through geological processes which has a characteristic chemical composition with large atomic structure and specific physical properties. To understand mineral users can see rock which don not need any specific chemical composition. Minerals range in composition from the pure elements to the simple salts to the extent of very complex silicates along with many known forms. So the readers of minerals is also called as mineralogy.</p>

<p>In order to classified as a pure mineral, the substances should be in a solid state carrying crystalline structure. Minerals should reflects as a homogeneous substance carrying a defined chemical composition. As per the International Mineralogical Association the definition of mineral goes just like that defined in 1995 : a mineral is an element or chemical compound appearing crystalline and obtained from the geological processes. The chemical composition differs many end members of the mineral system. Mineral-like substances which do not shows their properties of minerals are defined as mineraloids. Many other natural-occurring substances like non minerals. Minerals do get its name as per the usage in varied fields like industrial minerals used in the market and commercially as mined materials .</p>

<p>Crystal structure shows the ability of influencing the mineral’s physical properties. Diamond and graphite is having the same composition where graphite is found to be highly soft and diamond as the hardest of all famous minerals. As per the reports of the International Mineralogical Association there are 4000 minerals present in the nature. In order to know more about minerals people should read magazines and booklets in order to get benefited from these minerals source. Classifying the minerals is not an easy work as it ranges from simple to very difficult task. So one should understand that mineral is identified because of many physical properties. In several cases, minerals are shown as more complex chemical and X-ray diffraction analysis.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Earth has three motions. It spin like a top approximately an imaginary line called an axis that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole, it travels approximately the sun, and it moves through the Milky Way along with the sun and the take it easy of the solar system.</p>

<p>Earth takes 24 hours to spin completely around on its partnership so that the sun is in the same place in the sky. This stage is called a solar day. During a solar day, Earth moves a petite around its orbit so that it faces the stars a little another way each night. Thus, it only takes 23 hours 56 minutes 4.09 second for Earth to spin once so that the stars show to be in the same place in the sky. This phase is called a sidereal day. A sidereal day is shorter than an astrophysical day, so the stars appear to rise about 4 action earlier each day.</p>

<p>Earth takes 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes 9.54 seconds to sphere the sun. This measurement lengthwise of time is called a sidereal year. Because Earth does not spin a whole number of times as it goes just about the sun, the almanac gets out of step with the seasons by about 6 hours each year. Every four years, a day is added to bring the chart back into line with the seasons. These years, called leap years, have 366 days. The extra day is new to the end of February and occurs as February 29.</p>

<p>The distance in the order of Earth’s orbit is 584 million miles. Earth travels in its range at 66,700 miles (107,000 kilometers) an hour, or 18.5 miles (30 kilometers) a second. Earth’s path lies on an imaginary flat surface about the sun called the orbital plane.</p>

<p>Earth’s axis is not directly up and down, but is slanted by about 23 1/2 degrees compared to the orbital plane. This tilt and Earth’s motion just about the sun causes the change of the seasons. In January, the northern half of Earth tilts left from the sun. Sunlight is reach thinly over the northern half of Earth, and the north experiences winter. At the same time, the daylight falls extremely on the southern half of Earth, which has summer. By July, Earth has moved to the opposite side of the sun. Now the northern half of Earth tilts toward the sun. Sunlight falls intensely over the northern half of Earth, and the north experiences summer. At the same time, the sunlight falls less intensely on the southern half of Earth, which has winter.</p>

<p>Earth’s orbit is not a perfect circle. Earth is somewhat closer to the sun in early January (winter in the Northern Hemisphere) and out of away in July. In January, Earth is 91.4 million miles (147.1 million kilometers) from the sun, and in July it is 94.5 million miles (152.1 million kilometers) from the sun. This variation has a far smaller effect than the heating and cooling caused by the tilt of Earth’s axis.</p>

<p>Earth and the solar system are part of a vast disk of stars called the Milky Way Galaxy. Just as the moon orbits Earth and planets orbit the sun, the sun and other star orbit the tightly packed center of the Milky Way. The solar organization is about two-fifths of the way from the center of the Milky Way and revolves about the center at regarding 155 miles (249 kilometers) per second. The solar organization makes one whole revolution around the hub of the galaxy in regarding 220 million years.</p>

<p>In some areas, the field is thousands of times stronger than the overall compelling field. In these places, clusters of field lines break from first to last the shell, creating loops in the solar mood. At one end of the loop, the breakthrough point is a magnetic north pole. At this point, the direction of the field lines is rising — that is, away from the core. At the further end of the loop, the breakthrough point is a magnetic south pole, and the lines point downward. A sunspot forms at each point. The field lines guide ions and electrons into the breathing space above the sunspots, producing huge loops of gas.</p>

<p>The number of sunspots on the sun depends on the quantity of distortion in the field. The change in this number, from a minimum to a maximum and back to a least amount, is identified as the sunspot cycle. The average age of the sunspot cycle is about 11 years.</p>

<p>At the end of a sunspot cycle, the compelling fields quickly reverse its polarity and lose most of its buckle. Suppose the sun’s compelling North Pole and its geographic north pole were at the same place at the sound of a given cycle. At the commencement of the next cycle, the magnetic north pole would be at the same rest as the geographic South Pole. A vary of polarity from one direction to the other and reverse again equals the periods of two succeeding sunspot cycle and is therefore about 22 years.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2012/12/24/travel-europe-your-way/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Travel Europe Your Way!</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>If you’re going to Europe, and planning on traveling, rather than staying in the one place for the duration of your vacation, and you don’t want to spend a fortune, there’s two or three alternative ways that you can travel throughout the continent.</p>

<p>The first option would be to take what you might call the “traditional” budget alternative, which would generally be backpacking and traveling by train. Nothing wrong with that at all, and by using a pass on the trains that known as a Eurailpass, and available in the USA, you can certainly reduce your spending, whilst journeying widely throughout many countries.</p>

<p>There are, however, a couple of down sides to this traditional “budget” planning.</p>

<p>First, whilst it can often be exhilarating and exciting to meet and travel with strangers on a train, equally, sometimes, it’s nice to have your own space to enjoy the journey, on your own.</p>

<p>Secondly, by definition, trains can only take you as far as the railway station, and railway stations are not always placed where you want them to be placed. In other words, if you have definite “target” places that you want to see, then you might end up having to take a train, then a bus or taxi (for who knows what distances) before arriving at your destination. This shouldn’t be a problem if the place you so desperately want to visit is in the city, but what if it not?</p>

<p>And, of course, trains run to their timetable, not yours!</p>

<p>An alternative to trains are planes. Flying within Europe is now extremely cheap, and can be reasonably convenient, especially if you are visiting a country that it widely geared up for tourism.</p>

<p>For example, right now, it is possible to fly from the UK to beautiful Salzburg in Austria for GBP19 one way (approximately $35) or to Istanbul in Turkey for GBP31. See internet for more information on availability of flights and fares.</p>

<p>Budget flying, however, carries with it many of the disadvantages of the trains – crammed into small seats next to someone you have never met before, the inevitable delays and so on.</p>

<p>So, here’s my suggestion. If you are lucky enough to be planning an extended European adventure, (at least one month) then make it a real adventure of which you are in total control.</p>

<p>Travel by car. Then, you can go exactly where you want, when you want, you can choose your own company, and, basically, you’re the boss. Maybe you are now thinking, nothing so revolutionary in that, car hire is not exactly a new idea, is it?</p>

<p>No, it isn’t, but I’m not suggesting that you use Hertz, Avis or any of the other global car rental companies.</p>

<p>I’m suggesting that you do what I did some years ago for a three month tour of Europe.</p>

<p>BUY a car – a used model, something relatively cheap that you can then resell at a later date, before you fly home. Make sure that it’s a fairly basic model, something that is widely available throughout Europe (so that any required spare parts will be cheap and plentiful) and that it’s mechanically straightforward – no turbochargers or superchargers – so that if anything does go wrong with it on your travels, repairs will be simple (i.e. inexpensive) as well.</p>

<p>In my case, I traveled to Europe, bought an estate car (a station wagon) in France for $750, drove some 10,000kms throughout France, Spain, Portugal, Italy and so on, and sold it for $650 three months later. Apart from a couple of minor repairs (a new battery) and the cost of the gasoline, I lost exactly $100 on the deal.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I had gone exactly where I wanted, when I wanted and done exactly what I wanted to when I got there! Truly, the freedom of the open road!</p>

<p>Yes, it was travel on a budget, but it was definitely not what I would think of as budget travel!</p>

The time you spend training or doing something productive to get closer to your goal or dream, compared to sitting on your couch watching TV. Don’t get me wrong daydreaming can be productive if you know how to creatively visualize. Realize that your habits will determine your future. Successful people have successful habits, unsuccessful people don’t. To get your dream to materialize you need a plan to structure your time into productive slots. All successful people have a plan, follow it, and gauge their progress by it. Work towards making the majority of your time being productive towards your goal, i.e. training and conditioning, read and view material that is going to help you become a better fighter such as viewing video of your fights and your opponents to see what you need to work on.</p>

<p>IT’S ALL ABOUT WERE YOU PUT YOUR FOCUS</p>

<p>Ninety percent of your focus and energy should be directed at your fight plan and career if you want to succeed in the MMA world or in any goal in life. Instead of coming home from a long day at work kicking back with a beer and watching the game, put on an instructional DVD to help you learn new techniques or improve on your speed or power. Go to the gym left weights, do Cardio, strength train or work on techniques with your sparring partner. During work or on your way home visualize yourself in a match performing a technique you have recently learned, so it becomes ingrained in your subconscious and is in your arsenal. Build on your strengths, not on your weakness. There are three kinds of people, people that make things happen, people that watch things happen and people who say what just happened. Which one are you? So if you keep asking yourself why your fight career isn’t happening take an honest inventory of yourself because it’s about were we put the focus in our life that determines were we are going. If you keep on doing what you always done you’ll keep getting what you always got. Making your dreams become reality is not about luck, or “if it’s meant to be it will happen”. It’s all about were you put your focus.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Presentations are one of the first managerial skills which a junior engineer must acquire. This article looks at the basics of Presentation Skills as they might apply to an emergent manager.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>

<p>Management is the art of getting things done. A Presentation is a fast and potentially effective method of getting things done through other people. In managing any project, presentations are used as a formal method for bringing people together to plan, monitor and review its progress.</p>

<p>But let us look at this another way: what can a presentation do for you?</p>

<p>Firstly; it puts you on display. Your staff need to see evidence of decisive planning and leadership so that they are confident in your position as their manager. They need to be motivated and inspired to undertaking the tasks which you are presenting. Project leaders from other sections need to be persuaded of the merits of your project and to provide any necessary support. Senior management should be impressed by your skill and ability so that they provide the resources so that you and your team can get the job done.</p>

<p>Secondly; it allows you to ask questions and to initiate discussion. It may not be suitable within the presentation formats of your company to hold a discussion during the presentation itself but it does allow you to raise the issues, present the problems and at least to establish who amongst the audience could provide valuable input to your decision making.</p>

<p>Finally; presentations can be fun. They are your chance to speak your mind, to strut your stuff and to tell the people what the world is really like. While you hold the stage, the audience is bound by good manners to sit still and watch the performance.</p>
