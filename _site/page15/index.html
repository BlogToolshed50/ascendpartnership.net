  </header>

    <p>Modern business strategies and tactics often concentrate on developing international brands and products, but before developing any product it is important to assess the potential worldwide demand. While most companies do consider this aspect while developing a new product or brand, some companies concentrate on just getting worldwide acclaim and ubiquitous recognition. The result can be customer disappointment when the actual product fails to live up to the hype and disappointing sales.</p>

<p>Companies in the manufacturing and service sectors have realized that to achieve economies of scale they need to formulate management policies based on modern business strategies. Being able to sell the same product or market the same brand at the global level helps to increase the efficiency of their related industrial activities such as product packaging, graphics and advertising. They also gain all of the benefits that are derived from the use of common technology, product specifications, and raw materials. However, being actually able to maintain such global presence in a diverse world is much easier said than done. The simplest solution that companies have is to recognize common product preferences in different countries and make minor changes to the fundamental product design. This is the best way of optimizing their product or service for both the worldwide and local market at the same time. Modern business strategies are also associated with effective management of capital flows, human resources and other factors of production.</p>

<p>The use of information technology in almost every type of industrial process has contributed to the development of modern business strategies and tactics. With the aid of the Internet, information related to any new idea or design is distributed all over the world very quickly. This is why modern business strategies that support product development or facilities development have to move at a much faster speed than ever before. Any business strategy or tactic that is not up-to-date will prove ineffective when it comes to achieving departmental and organizational targets.</p>

<p>Modern business strategies lay stress on using the latest communication tools such as video conferencing and e-mail for improving communication within the organization as well as with clients. Project management techniques used in some of the biggest multinational companies such as Sony, Intel, Microsoft, Time and others are based on such modern business strategies. With multi-billion dollar mergers becoming a norm, companies are concentrating on formulating innovative strategies rather than just concentrating on established management techniques. Organizations such as Glaxo-Welcome and Merck, who have grown through mergers and acquisitions, have reorganized their international product lines with the help of modern business strategies and techniques.</p>

<p>With the help of modern procurement strategies, global giants have managed to build and operate production centers in international locations at the least possible cost and in minimal time. If modern business strategies are implemented properly, they can easily accommodate for the diversity that exists between countries. These can be used to develop innovative project management methods that can help achieve greater uniformity and economies of scale across the business. They encourage knowledge-based innovation and help develop the ability to execute on commitments and deliver higher standards of customer satisfaction. Modern business strategies revolve around producing and marketing international products and brands that are then tailored to local markets. As such, in today’s world of globalization, the concept of localization has become inherent in almost all modern business strategies.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2012/11/19/what-are-the-nutritional-needs/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">What are the Nutritional Needs?</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Nutrition as it applies to our daily lives means that we take in what we need to maintain our body’s healthy state. Nutrition has become an important word thanks to the involvement of the USDA in our daily food requirements, and the FDA’s involvement in determining what is and is not dangerous for us to consume.</p>

<p>But what is our responsibility in the nutrition game? Do we understand what our nutritional requirements are, how to fulfill those requirements, and how to look for real nutritional value in our foods?</p>

<p>I’m not sure that nutrition has been successfully addressed in its own right. We hear nutrition in relation to our vitamin intake, our fortified cereals and milk, and in the context that we need “nutritional value” from our food choices. But what really is nutrition when applied to our daily bodily functions?</p>

<p>Today, we must determine how much nourishment we need, how much physical exercise we need, and how best to accomplish those ends. Calorie needs, nutritional needs, physical needs, and education about those needs now is information we should all understand, at least as it applies to our individual self.</p>

<p>If you will visit your local doctor, library, or fitness center, there is massive amounts of information available to help educate and to help you make good health choices, no matter what the age group.</p>

<p>Nutrition refers to the nurturing of our body, in our ability to keep it healthy and functioning as it is supposed to do. Our ability to provide the body with all it’s necessary food, vitamins, and minerals so that we continue to thrive in our daily life processes.</p>

<p>If you were to take a cross section of the population, and check for adequate levels of the most used and fortified vitamins and minerals, you would probably find that as high as 80% or the population is lacking in a least one of the vitamins and minerals.</p>

<p>Now, that doesn’t sound too bad, until you stop to think, what if it’s calcium? A calcium deficiency brings on osteoporosis, a deteriorating of the bone. This disease alone costs millions in medical expense to the population.</p>

<p>Can you see how a little more cooperation and open-minded participation on the part of our medical field could result in far fewer health problems? It would also have provided the general population with a viable way to discern their nutrition, vitamin and mineral needs, accurately.</p>

<p>So how do we determine that we are providing the essential nutritional needs? That knowledge comes by educating ourselves about what our individual needs are, the needs of our family, and then taking that knowledge and applying it to the foods we buy, that we prepare, and that our families consume.</p>

<p>Quite often, our vitamin and mineral needs outweigh our caloric needs. In those instances, we turn to manufactured vitamins and minerals to fill the gap. This is a part of our nutritional needs, also.</p>

<p>Nutrition is one of the most complex areas to gain useful knowledge about, because there are so many components, and because each person has their own individual needs.</p>

<p>Women needs differ from those of men, and older women needs differ from those of a young girl. As we age, our needs constantly change; therefore continual education about nutrition is a fact of life. The nutritional needs of a cardiac patient are different than those of a healthy, middle-aged hiker.</p>

<p>Can you see the complexity of the situation now? What we really need is to develop a scale that determines the nutritional needs of our bodies on a cellular level, so that as we age, as our physical condition changes, or our health changes, we can recalculate our needs, based on cellular changes and content in our body.</p>

<p>Individuality is the key to understanding each person’s nutritional needs, and then working to educate us is the key to fulfilling those nutritional needs. Good nutrition should be the ultimate goal of every person alive.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2012/11/12/tips-for-making-a-great-impression/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Tips for Making a Great Impression!</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>I have coached executives for more than 20 years. In working with successful leaders and professionals, I have found that making lasting impressions on the people you work with is pivotal to your advancement. Here are some tips to make sure you’re putting your best foot forward.</p>

<p>• Look the Part:</p>

<p>“One of the easiest things you can do is look the part. However talented you are, if you don’t look like a professional, manager or leader, others may, rightly or wrongly, not see you as one. Observe the styles and colors favored by senior executives, and use that as a guide. For women, black and blue are “safe” colors, but make you blend in. A small or shy woman can augment her impact with bold shades. A confident or larger woman might consider wearing a more muted shade.”</p>

<p>• Sound the Part:</p>

<p>“Short, simple sentences, spoken without hesitation, make a speaker seem in control of a situation – a quality we associate with a leader. Tone and volume are important too. Short, precise sentences and a low-pitched but clearly audible voice make a powerful combination.”</p>

<p>• Exits and Entrances Matter:</p>

<p>“How you move into and out of jobs has an enormous impact on perceptions of your success. Exiting a job well is about ensuring that your successor is in the loop, included in key meetings, and prepared enough to be able to step smoothly into your place. It is not about tying up every loose end. Although it’s important to move forward in an orderly way, it’s even more important to know when to leave behind your old role and expertise.”</p>

<p>• Your Work Space Reflects Who You Are:</p>

<p>“Whether you like it or not, others interpret your work area as a reflection of your personality and thinking. Decor is an area in which to tread carefully. While judicious use of personal pictures can show you to be a family person or motivated character, cuddly toys and an excess of plants can detract from your professionalism. It isn’t that self-expression is bad, but in the small area of a work space, each item becomes more noticeable, taking on greater significance as a symbol of who you are.”</p>

<p>• Every Presentation is an Opportunity:</p>

<p>“If your moment in the spotlight goes badly, your reputation can be damaged. You minimize risk, and maximize potential glory, through careful preparation. Preparation isn’t just about knowing your subject, although that is important. You must prepare for your audience and their expectations, determining in advance what you want to leave them with so that you can tailor your presentation to that end. Think about how you want to come across, through the words you use, how you look, your facial expressions, and how you respond to questions.”</p>

  </header>

    <p>Regardless of the state of the economy, many people find themselves a little strapped for money around the holidays. Heating costs, food for holiday gatherings, holiday travel costs, and gifts all factor in to making November through January the most expensive time of the year. Luckily, as much as this time of year can cost more, there are more opportunities to make a little bit of money to offset these inflated expenses. Below, well share with you the top five ways to earn a little extra cash over the holidays.</p>

<p>Tip 1 – Manual Labor</p>

<p>Fall is called “fall” for a reason. Leaves fall off of trees and if they just stay on peoples lawns it is bad for the grass underneath. That’s why they invented rakes. One thing about raking – people hate to do it. That’s why they invented leaf blowers. So, if you invest in a leaf blower, you can take care of peoples leaves for them without having to rake peoples leaves? Easy enough, right? Once the snow starts falling; you can shovel snow for extra dough – or use a little of your leaf-blowing money to invest in a snow blower. Other things to consider – cleaning out gutters, hanging holiday lights, and winterizing windows with that shrink wrap stuff.</p>

<p>Tip 2 – Babysit</p>

<p>Let your friends, family, and coworkers know that you’re available to babysit during holiday shopping excursions ( a nightmare chore when you have to bring the little ones along), and during holiday parties. If you’re a bonafide adult with some experience taking care of kids you can likely charge about $10 per hour. And once people find out you’re willing to babysit word travels fast. You’ll be fielding calls left and right. Just make sure you keep plenty of crayons, coloring books, and kid-friendly movies on hand you’ll be their favorite babysitter in no time!</p>

<p>Tip 3 – Hawk Your Stuff</p>

<p>You could start randomly selling stuff on E-bay, but remember that you have to pay to put stuff up there. If you’ve already got an account that’s great, and you can start your spring cleaning a little early and get rid of unwanted, but still good quality stuff. Of course, if you’ve got lots of good stuff, don’t forget about the option of re-gifting. One mans trash, etc. Another great idea is to sell your old gold through a respectable online company. You can contact them and they send you a bag to put your stuff in. You put your old gold, silver, your old silverware, and your old gold coins in the bag, send it off, and payday! Pretty easy, if you’ve got that kind of stuff sitting around your house.</p>

<p>Tip 4 – Get Crafty</p>

<p>The website that sells exclusively hand-crafted items. For a small fee you can sign up and post your wares. If you’re a craft-type of person, this is a good way to sell your handmade goods and make a name for yourself. If you are in need of a little more instant-gratification cash, sign up for a craft fair or holiday bazaar and man a booth with your stuff. If you are more of a Betty Crockery-type, try making some cookies or candies to give as gifts or sell to friends and coworkers. Everybody loves a little sweetness during the holiday season.</p>

<p>Tip 5 – Retail</p>

<p>Many retailers hire on extra help for the holiday shopping season. You could get hired and trained before Black Friday, and work those crazy holiday shifts to get some extra money. The best part of all of it? You will likely get an employee discount, so don’t apply for places you don’t want to shop. In addition to making some money, you can save some money too. Talk about getting more bang for your buck!</p>

<p>Whatever ways you decide to bring in extra cash this year, make sure you do it safely, and make sure you save enough time and energy for your friends and family. Because that’s what the holiday season is really about, after all.</p>

  </header>

    <p>This fun day is observed on 12th or 14th of April. I wonder if anyone knows about the origin of this day. But the idea is beautiful and one must admire the imagination of whoever thought of this day.</p>

<p>What are we supposed to do on this day? Look at the sky! As I write this article, I am seeing two birds flying away in the sky. The sky is light blue in color with little gray near the horizon. There are little or rather no clouds and it is a clear sky. It is about 5 PM in the evening and the sun will be setting in about two hours here. Now I see a pigeon fluttering its wings coming at speed near me and then flying away. Now I see bright sun light opposite my home. The sun was not that brilliant before a minute. I never knew that the sky changes in mood so fast and has so much to offer. Don’t we all ignore the beautiful sky all our life? Most of us reserve observing such things on holidays in distant places. Ever wondered why? Bring some of these sights on your desktops.</p>

<p>It is our structure of working that prevents us enjoying such beautiful sights as the sky in our daily life. Our work takes away most of our time and the other is spent on household chores or watching television. Sometimes I think why people become so excited to watch the sun on the eclipse day? The sun is there everyday, but we feel totally unconcerned with it, unless it is very hot. Am I right? Same thing with the moon and the stars. How many of us step out on a night only to watch the stars? Why not view some sunset shots.</p>

<p>Stars are so fascinating. Some of them are so far that it takes light, millions of years to reach us. That means that we are watching the star as it was million of years ago. Some of them are traveling away from us and some are collapsing to become black holes. It must be very dark there, isn’t it? How small all of us are compared to this cosmos.</p>

<p>The sky is lovely during the day and equally lovely at the nights. The birds of all kinds, clouds, the changing colors of the sky, all make it a great panoramic sight during the days and the nights are so peaceful with the moon and the distant stars. The only piece missing is our observation. We have no time to watch and derive joy from the nature that is around us.</p>
