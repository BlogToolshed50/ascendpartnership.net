  </header>

    <p>Long ago, trying to find an insurance company that would pay for chiropractic treatment was a losing endeavor. Chiropractic practitioners were once considered to have more in common with holistic healers than licensed medical personnel. Until recently, massage therapy and those who performed it were viewed by the medical and insurance establishments in much the same way.</p>

<p>Fortunately, gone are the days when massage therapy held the negative connotation of being a pseudo-science and brought to mind images of self-taught, out-call therapists with cheap portable massage tables and suspect skills. Massage therapists certainly still make out-calls, but changes in the way the profession is regulated have legitimized the industry and revitalized the image of those in the field. Today’s massage therapists are highly trained professionals whose work is widely accepted by the medical community. Though many work for themselves or as an employee of a private company, more and more are finding employment in medical facilities where their skills are in high demand.</p>

<p>Massage therapy programs are offered by many accredited colleges and universities across the nation, and graduates are encouraged to test for national certification. Those who pass the comprehensive test administered by the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork have the freedom to pursue the best job opportunities health care while those without national certification are generally self employed. In either case, the financial compensation is rising at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>As more people realize the therapeutic benefits of massage, its popularity and acceptance have grown. Surprisingly, young adults are the demographic that bring about the majority of business for self-employed massage therapists. This speaks volumes for the long term demand that those in the field will enjoy, as most who engage in massage therapy at a younger age are likely to continue enjoying its benefits well into their twilight years. By contrast, the elderly constitute the largest portion of those who seek massage therapy in a medical setting. As the baby boomer generation continues to age, the number of elderly requiring treatment will steadily increase.</p>

<p>Whether in a clinic, hospital, long term care facility, office, home or health club, people are starting to realize the value of a good massage. A massage therapist’s knowledge of anatomy and human musculature can make a world of difference to those who suffer from chronic back pain, spinal injuries and muscle tension. As a result, massage therapists are now finally being compensated at a rate commensurate with what they bring to the table, whether they bring the table or not.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Although there are somethings we wish could last forever or a moment we wish would never end, ultimately they do. The memory of the special event, however, can be preserved for us to recall and enjoy for a long time to come. Drying flowers is a simple and inexpensive way to preserve these cherished moments. There are multiple ways to use your flowers and preserve them for crafts and decorations. Whether they were a gift, or from a special day they can be made into something to enjoy long after that time has passed.</p>

<p>One way to preserve flowers and use in crafts is by hanging them to dry. If you decide to preserve your flowers whole, and intact, you will need to decide this before they have fully bloomed. If a flower has opened up too much, when it is dried the petals will fall off. The brighter and more vivid the fresh flower is, the better color it will have as it dries. If you want more intense colors, be sure to start with that trait in the fresh flower. If the dried flower will be used with it’s stem, it would be best to wire the stem while the flower is still fresh. Then attach the flower, upside down, to a wire hanger and leave in a dark place for two to three weeks. If the dried flowers will be stored a while before use, cover them with a light material, such as tissue paper to keep the dust off.</p>

<p>Flowers preserved in this way can be used for a variety of purposes. For a special event, such as a wedding, some people want to preserve their bouquets. After following drying instructions bouquets can be placed as a wall hanging next to the wedding photo, in a shadow box, or simply placed on a table or in a hutch. After flowers are dried they can also be put back in a vase and set on a table. If a single flower is preserved, perhaps to save on space, it can be laid over the wedding frame on in front of the wedding photo. Individually dried flowers can also be used when making a wreath. Flowers do not have to have special meaning, any flower that dries well can be used to make an arrangement. In addition to adding a variety of leaves, berries, ribbon or other embellishments, dried flowers look beautiful in a wreath. Sometimes less is more, if your wreath is not looking right, try lessening the amount of items in it.</p>

<p>Flowers can also be preserved by being pressed. This method is simple and can be used for things you want to keep forever, or for special cards or invitations. Although you can buy kits to press, they can also be made by having several layers of cardboard stacked with flowers laid out on each sheet and then bound with adjustable straps that you can tighten to ensure a successful drying process. Pressed flowers are very versatile in their uses. When making wedding announcements a pressed flower of the wedding colors is a beautiful addition to the invitations. They can also be used to make cards or baby announcements. Another option for pressed flowers is to place them as a garden scene in an old window or frame. Glue them on a separate piece of glass, not part of the original frame, cut to the same size and then placed and secured to the frame. Any size can be attractive and used any where in a home, from a bathroom to bedroom. The flowers do not have to be the center of the picture, but can also be placed around a photo or poem on the mat. This is a wonderful way to incorporate the flowers to the event, but do it in a small, elegant way.</p>

<p>If you can find a way to preserve special memories they will bring joy for years. Although fresh flowers are beautiful, dried ones can be just as enjoyable. By finding various ways to use your flowers, you will be surrounded by your memories and remember those happy times when life might be more difficult</p>

  </header>

    <p>Before going on about energy, let’s define it first. Energy may mean a lot of things. In this article, we refer energy as a source of usable power which is obtained from various sources and is converted to electricity for man’s consumption. That’s where the problem comes in. Most people are not aware but we are slowly but surely depleting our energy/resources. So how bad is it really?</p>

<p>Well, let’s cite a few facts: everyday we hear in the news that oil reserves are depleting. Brown/black outs occur frequently, gas prices are increasing, etc. The Americans alone consume twice as much electric power per ca pita than the British, and six times as much as the world average. The U.S. demand for energy is increasing at such a fast rate, doubling every 15 years. In fact, back in 1999, the U.S. consumed 95 quadrillion BTUs of energy but only produced 61 quadrillion BTUs. Do the math, and that’s a 34 quadrillion BTU energy deficit. It does not take a genius to figure out that the rate is alarming.</p>

<p>People want more gasoline to turn the wheels in their cars, more natural gas to heat the homes in winter time and more electricity to cool their houses in the summer. The problem is fairly obvious. We consume more energy than we produce. That’s why we import energy from other countries to keep our lights on and our appliances running. So is it possible for our world to lose all its standard energy/resources? Yes, it is. Geophysicists from the U.S Geological Survey predicted that 90% of all oil and gas will be gone by 2035, and roughly about 90% of all coal will be depleted by 2300. This may sound a long time from now, but the fact is, that day will arrive, and that day is coming. Think about the future of our children and our grand children. That thought alone should open our eyes to do something about it now.</p>

<p>The good news is that experts believe technology can supply more alternate sources of power as time goes by. In the meantime, we must do our parts in conserving energy. Start at home: turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth; turn off the lights and appliances when they are not in use; if you are going somewhere that’s close, try walking instead of driving; improve insulation in private homes; recycle and reuse products that can be turned into something usable again. Not only that: we have renewable energy sources. What’s this? This is the energy we get from the sun, the wind, the water. So we are not so bad off after all if we just tap on the right sources.</p>

<p>Let’s all pitch in. This is our world we are trying to save, our world where we belong, for the future of our children and so on, so forth</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2014/01/22/tips-for-communicating-with-children/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Tips for Communicating with Children</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Most people have more training before they receive their driver’s license than before they become a parent. Educating yourself on how to communicate effectively with your child can be the key to achieving your parenting goals. If you do not have children of your own, these 10 tips can help you whenever you are around children.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Draw children out to speak about the things on their minds.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can ‘prime the pump’ by talking with them about their favorite foods, toys, movies, video games, etc.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Verbally reflect the emotions of a child before giving in to your need to teach them something.</li>
</ol>

<p>Parents are constantly making the error of educating their child when their child expresses pain. “I hate my nose” is often responded to with, “you have a perfectly good nose” and the child is left to feel all alone with what could become an enormous problem for them in years to come.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Teach your child to wait instead of interrupting your conversations.</li>
</ol>

<p>One technique is to teach your children to lightly touch your arm and to wait peacefully and quietly to be acknowledged by you. Children who interrupt miss a chance to learn to control their impulses and can upset the flow of an adult’s conversation.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Play little games whenever you see children.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, you could put something such as a coin in a hand behind your back and ask the child to guess which hand it is in. This is a way to build a strong connection with a child and make a child feel honored.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Lower yourself physically to a child’s level by sitting down, bending down, or sitting on the floor.</li>
</ol>

<p>It may have been months since any adult has joined the child on their own level.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hold and play with a child’s toys or trinkets.</li>
</ol>

<p>Play is the language of a child. If you stop for even thirty seconds to draw a picture alongside of a child who is coloring, you could become one of their heroes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tell short stories to children.</li>
</ol>

<p>Make the stories up or pull them from your own childhood. Stories can be used to build a connection, to teach a lesson, or just to leave a child feeling better than when the conversation began.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Follow up on the promises that you make to children with action.</li>
</ol>

<p>Children are usually more hurt than adults by broken promises. Ironically, many people treat their promises to children as less important than their promises to adults.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sacrifice some of your time to interact with children and to focus on them 100%.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most adults do not interact with children who are present because the children are not able to meet their needs the way that an adult can. Five minutes invested in the life of a child will pay dividends that an hour invested in the life of an adult may not.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Master the art of Socratic questioning. This means that instead of expressing facts or lecturing that you ask a question to stimulate the child’s own reasoning process. Socratic questioning opens up a place in a person’s mind for the answer to be remembered. For example, you could ask, “How do you think we could take better care of the puppy?” instead of telling your child what to do.</li>
</ol>

    <p>Do you want your children to have an excellent life? Are you interested in helping other people reach their full potential? You can achieve these goals by instilling your knowledge.</p>

<p>Teach your kids as many things as you can. Have you heard of “the birds and the bees”? It is very important that you start being a parental teacher in the early years of your kids’ lives. You should read with your toddler and teach him or her reading and language skills. You should also teach him or her discipline, the laws, financial skills and critical thinking skills. Teach him or her to obey the rules and laws, respect authority, treat everyone with respect, control his or her anger at all times, refrain from violence, solve all problems through peace and logic and avoid a fight at all times. Teach your child everything you know.</p>

<p>Teach other people your skills. If you know how to do something well, teach someone how to do it. A few years ago, I was a member of the St. Louis Chapter of The Association of Black Journalists. From January 2003 to April 2003, I helped the association conduct a writing workshop called The Minority Journalism Workshop. The workshop was sponsored by The St. Louis Post-Dispatch and held at The University of Missouri at St. Louis. A few people who work at The St. Louis Post-Dispatch and KDSK Channel 5 shared their knowledge of journalism. The purpose of the workshop was to help local minority high school seniors learn to become journalists and earn a journalism scholarship to The University of Missouri at St. Louis. As students worked on their assignments, I walked around the classroom and checked to see how they were doing. I helped them correct spelling and grammatical errors and I made sure that they were following the instructions from the teachers.</p>

<p>I have also taught a few people how to play tennis. Tennis players should always have their knees bent; react to an oncoming ball by turning to the side with the front foot pointing to the north and the back foot pointing to the east; and hit the tennis ball in a clockwise motion. What I mean by a clockwise motion is that the player should raise the head of his or her tennis racket toward the sky, lower the racket head toward the ground and bring the racket head toward his or her shoulder. To serve the ball, the player should raise his or her tennis racket overhead, toss the ball up high and come down on the ball while leaning forward to put his or her weight into the serve to produce a more powerful serve.</p>

<p>Teach new hires or applicants. If you are an experienced employee at your job, you should teach a new co-worker how to succeed with the company. If you are a hiring manager, you should be willing to hire and train a skilled, educated applicant who does not have as much experience as you might like. After all, how can someone get the experience if you will not let him or her get it?</p>

<p>If you have a desire to mold young minds, you should study to become a teacher, teacher assistant or substitute teacher. I was a substitute teacher in St. Louis, Missouri for five years. My most fulfilling substitute teaching experience came over a year ago when I taught a computer keyboarding class at School. The students used computer typing games to work on their assignments. I walked around the classroom to monitor their progress. I taught some of them the fingers you must use to hit certain keys. For example, you must use the fifth finger on your left hand to type a Z, an A and a Q. You must use the fifth finger on your right hand to type a P. I also explained to the students that you must use your left hand to type the letters that are on the left side of the keyboard and you must use your right hand to type the letters that are on the right side of the keyboard. Achieve your goal of helping others by instilling your knowledge!</p>
