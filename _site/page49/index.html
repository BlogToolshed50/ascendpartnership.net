  </header>

    <p>When it comes to an event, you need to make sure that you make it educational, entertaining, and memorable. This is extremely important when you have to place a charity event in the making. So what makes an event all these things? Well you should look at each of them separately. What can you do to make an even educational? What can you do to make it entertaining? What will make this a memorable event that no one will be able to forget?</p>

<p>First, look at the educational aspect. What is the charity or event for? You need to state your purpose or goal everywhere. You can do this in several ways. Once way that you can be educational is by placing stands or show pieces around the event like an art show. Place random facts on the walls or on display so that you can get your guests thinking. You can put on a movie or documentary about the charity and show the people first hand what is really going on and why they should help. You could also do a speech with the help of visual aids to help support your charity. All of these are great ideas when it comes to making something educational, but what about entertaining.</p>

<p>Well if you want just entertainment you can have a band or singer perform at the event. However, that can be expensive. If you are having a charity, you should make sure that you mix entertainment with educational. Basically, you should try to find ways like through plays and other art forms to entertain and to educate. You never know how creative you can get until you try to mix education and entertainment. When you try to mix them you will find that your creativity will pour out ideas and you’ll have success in doing so. You need to make sure that the entertainment is clean and fun, especially for charity events.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Guest post of the week by Brittany Booker</p>

<p>I love shopping online with hughes net satellite internet because it is often so much cheaper than shopping in a store. Besides the benefit of being able to shop from home and not actually having to go to a store, shopping online is a great way to save money. One of the reasons that this is so cheap is that online-only retailers, like Amazon, don’t have to collect sales tax, which makes items quite a bit cheaper. This has to do with laws that only require a company to collect sales tax from residents in states where that company has a physical presence. Often times, on large enough purchases, I find that it is so much cheaper to buy items online that that makes up for the shipping charge, and still results in it being cheaper from online.</p>

<p>Buying from online with my hughesnet internet packages is a great way to save money. Also, one advantage that large online retailers have is that they don’t have to run stores, and so that saves them money, and allows them to make products cheaper. I really enjoy shopping online because of the money it saves me.</p>

  </header>

    <p>It might take a little coffee or probably a few rounds of beer or any other booze you could get your hands on when it comes to relaxing after a hard day’s work. Well, yeah I’m guilty about that one as well, unless I’m caught dead wearing a lampshade over my head after a few rounds of vodka… half-naked! Okay, bad example and I apologize to everyone reading this after getting nightmares about me in that state of drunken stupor.</p>

<p>Just don’t ask how it happened, please.</p>

<p>But what’s really interesting is that how do people go through the usual part of life when faced with vein-popping stress? I mean, the new age thing like Zen or yoga is one of the good things and it actually works. Is there room for the intellectual side of people who can actually smell the roses-in-a-can while on the move? It kind of had me thinking that there really must be something in this ‘mind-over-matter’ thing.</p>

<p>Humor is indeed the best medicine there is whenever you are. I mean anyone can pay good money to listen to a comedian just to make you wet your pants after laughing so hard. Despite of what’s been happening, and to those who has gone though the ordeal, it’s better to just laugh while facing the troubles with a clear mind than anger with a clouded vision. One of my favorite celebrities of all time may have to be Woody Allen. Now this is one guy who gives you the in-your-face bluntness that he pulls out with gusto, even without even trying. You can talk just about anything with a man, and he’s bound to mock the subject and you’ll end up laughing rather than being upset about it.</p>
