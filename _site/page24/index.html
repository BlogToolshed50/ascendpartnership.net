    <p>Deforestation is one of the facts of natural calamity due to increase the global warming. It got the most adverse impact on carbon emission according to the latest study at Australia. Thick forests serve as the sink to store he carbon and reduces the release into the atmosphere. It is observed that as much as 640 Tons of carbon is found in an area of an acre of thick forest.</p>

<p>If deforestation is done the carbon gets released into the atmosphere and pollutes the air. Hence, it is a must that we should preserve the forest. If we want to save our planet, we are planting plants in the waste lands that help to reduce the global warming.</p>

  </header>

    <p>For many people adult autism is just the way of life. They have to endure living with this disorder, which can be very difficult because they can’t function as normal people can function. For some people, they have learned to accept this disorder and live with it, but what makes it really difficult for some, is how those around them treat them and by society in general. As a society, we should try our best to study and learn and understand what adult autism is and not just for those who were diagnosed with this disorder. By learning as much as we can as a society, we can better help those who have to live with this disorder for which there is no known cure for. After all, these are people too, just like the rest of us and are just as important as everyone else’s.</p>

<p>This Disorder is Not a Curse</p>

<p>There many people who do not see adult autism as a curse. In fact, there are many people who actually enjoy being autistic. They considered being autistic a part of who they are and wouldn’t have it any other way. They don’t want to be cured; they just want to be accepted by everyone. Yes, they too have strengths and weaknesses like everyone else, but most of all, they are people and have every right to enjoy life just like you and me.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, autism starts in infancy. What this means is that this person has been living with this disorder for some time now. Autistic adults see the world differently from others. Their five senses work normally, however their brains just process the information differently. The way information is processed and stored and interpreted are slightly different from that of a normal person. Some experts believe that this may cause some of the more detrimental effects of autism, such as fits and tantrums. Reacting to the world normally would be extremely difficult for someone that already has a lot of stress and anxiety.</p>

<p>Heightened Senses</p>

<p>With some individuals, they have heightened senses or uncontrollable senses. What this basically means is that very often they can’t decide if they’re hungry or stuffed, hot or cold. Some autistics can’t stand bad, strong odors or loud noises; and most do not like being touched or any other forms of contact from other people. Often times, they will reject hugs and kisses or any other acts of affection. Some people will see this as weird or unusual.</p>

<p>Trying to socialize with others can be a real challenge for people with adult autism. That is why it is a good idea to get them involved in programs and activities that encourage human contact and teach them how to socialize with others. And just as important, we must educate those around us about this disorder, so that we can assist autistic adults in their struggle to fit in. By teaching others about this disorder, we can hopefully develop into a more understanding and accepting society.</p>
