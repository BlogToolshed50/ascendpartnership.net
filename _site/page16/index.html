  </header>

    <p>Have you ever wondered if what you know about Affiliate Marketing is accurate? Consider the following paragraphs and compare what you know to the latest info on Affiliate Marketing.</p>

<p>The idea of being mere passengers on a ship meant to sail to the farthest points does not appeal to people who like to put their destiny into their own hands. They have the desire of maneuvering the ships themselves, of being able to be the ones to take it anywhere they want to. Being aboard a ship on its way to a particularly great destination is something each and every one of them dreams of, and the knowledge that they have the capacity to steer it themselves is what makes them actually want to.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the reason why more and more people are succumbing to one of the most popular businesses around – affiliate marketing. It is because in this business, there are no bosses to order the employees around. There are no deadlines to meet and no clutter of work do to. One only needs to be equipped with the tools needed to succeed in a business such as this, and he is bound to get what his heart ultimately desires.</p>

<p>Just what are the things needed to be able to succeed in affiliate marketing? What must one have within himself to be able to do well in this industry? There is a lot of competition involved in affiliate marketing, and to be able to rise above the norm, one must be equipped with just the right stuff necessary to propel him forward. There are five things one must ultimately possess if he wants to achieve the glory he is yearning for in this business, and these five things are a must for him to possess to be able to stand out among the rest.</p>

<p>1.The very first quality one must possess if he wants to try his hand in affiliate marketing is the willingness to learn and be trained. Treading through unfamiliar territory is scary stuff if one is not properly equipped, and he might get lost amidst a jungle of the unknown. Learning the tricks of the trade is also an important aspect of the game, and one’s willingness to know it all will give him far better advantages in the business than he could ever imagine.</p>

<p>2.The second quality one must possess is the willingness to invest time and effort even if direct results do not seem at all apparent. Although several months may pass without good news, it is important for one who has his foot in the industry to hold on and wait. It is this quality which would save him from giving up after investing a lot of himself in the business.</p>

<p>See how much you can learn about Affiliate Marketing when you take a little time to read a well-researched article? Don’t miss out on the rest of this great information.</p>

<p>3.The third quality one must possess is self-determination. If one wants to conquer the affiliate marketing world, he must have the ability to push himself ahead. Never having to say die is a quality each and every affiliate marketer should possess, and the ability to motivate oneself into scaling greater heights is an ability which would actually take an affiliate marketer there.</p>

<p>4.The fourth quality one must possess is discipline. If one knows how to teach himself to work everyday with all the energy he can muster, then he is close to achieving what he has set his heart to having in the first place.</p>

<p>5.The fifth and last quality one must possess is optimism. Negative attitudes and hear-says should not discourage an affiliate marketer from pursuing what he has to in order to make life better for himself and for everyone concerned. Neither should anyone influence his attitude toward the business, because once in it, it is a must for him to be the captain of his ship and the master of his soul.</p>

<p>The ingredients to success in a business such as affiliate marketing are diverse and manifold, but the most important thing one needs to be able to make it big lies in himself alone. It is he who has the capacity to do everything to be able to realize his prospects, and the desire which fuels his heart in doing so is the gasoline which should keep the engine going.</p>

<p>Affiliate marketing is all about putting one’s fate into his own hands. The right attitude is the key to being able to steer one’s ship into that part of the ocean where a certain kind of serenity can be found, one that permeates the atmosphere as the ship sails calmly on.</p>

  </header>

    <p>In a quality investment guide risk assessment, a key principle, will be addressed. If we are to be successful in our investment endeavors and to ensure that we have a portfolio that is going to provide us with consistent rewards we must fully understand risk and how it applies to our personal character as well as our portfolio structure. Risk is something that we deal with in almost every aspect of our life. And we as a society are very aware of risk and do many things to reduce risk in our lives. We will purchase health, auto and life insurance. We make sure that all our children are using seat belts and helmets under certain conditions. We will check out the prospective of a company before submitting a resume.</p>

<p>There are many more things I can point out but what is amazing is that a majority of the time when it come to investing we do not complete an investment risk assessment. So many investors fail to identify or measure the risk involved, instead they look for the maximum rewards. In fact this is one of the biggest mistakes that is made by investors both novice and experienced. A portfolio should not be structured around the maximum reward instead it should be structured around the highest amount of reward with the least amount of risk. A portfolio built on a strategy of highest return vs.</p>

<p>lowest risk is what leads to a successful portfolio that will help you accomplish your personal investment goals. This is why rather then focus on maximum returns the smart investor focuses on Return vs. Risk. But part of that formulation is also understanding what risk is and knowing what your personal risk tolerance is when structuring your portfolio. Total risk assessment has several variables when undertaking an investment risk analysis of one’s portfolio. There is the risk of the asset allocation that we are all aware or heard about but there is also your personal characteristics that are a very important factor as well. How much you can personally afford to lose will not be the same as say your son. Also how much risk you can emotionally tolerate will not be the same as the next individual.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2012/10/01/solar-energy/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Solar Energy</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Once a distant technology that just sat on roofs that a few green minded people used, solar power has become a trendy tool we can hold in our hands. Sunlight – solar energy – can be used to generate electricity, provide hot water, and to heat, cool, and light buildings.</p>

<p>A typical solar system will reduce the need for conventional water heating by about two-thirds. Often the plumbing from a solar heater connects to a houses existing water heater, which stays inactive as long as the water coming in is hot or hotter than the temperature setting on the indoor water heater. When it falls below this temperature, the homes water heater can kick in to make up the difference. Incorporating passive solar designs can reduce heating bills by as much as 50 percent. High-temperature solar water heaters can provide energy-efficient hot water and hot water heat for large commercial and industrial facilities.</p>

<p>Many large commercial buildings can use solar collectors to provide more than just hot water. Solar process heating systems can be used to heat these buildings. A solar ventilation system can be used in cold climates to preheat air as it enters a building. And the heat from a solar collector can even be used to provide energy for cooling a building. The Co-operative Insurance Building in Manchester has the largest commercial solar system in the UK. I think it looks very futuristic and cool!</p>

<p>You can generate electricity for a single building like the co-op but there is the potential in the future to generate enough power for a power plant. The author of a recent Christian Aid report, John McGhie, said that for $50bn (£26bn) the whole of sub-Saharan Africa could be turned into a solar-generated economy. And $50bn is exactly the same amount as the continent would have to pay on extra fuel bills from oil,” he said.</p>

<p>Electrical retailer is about to add a new item to its usual array of washing machines and other white goods – solar panels. This is taking a risk as the solar panels will cost far more than anything else the store sells. They say it will cost the average three bedroom household about £9,000 to buy and install solar panels – compared to £16,000 in specialist stores. There are also grants available through the Low Carbon Buildings Program.</p>

<p>What other solar gadgets can you buy?</p>

<p>Well, Sharp, the world’s number one solar cell producer, has just turned its hand to glass studded with LED lights and cells. Instead of generating enough electricity to run a home, it creates a psychedelic light show at night, powered entirely by the day’s sun.</p>

<p>You can also buy solar chargers for iPods and phones. Other recent outlandish additions include a solar-powered tent, scooter and LED house numbers, while mundane ones like bike lights, torches and radios have been around for years.</p>

<p>People can also use captured passive solar heat to cook food. A basic cooker consists of an insulated box with a glass top. Heat from concentrated sunlight gets trapped in the box and can be used to heat food enclosed in the box. These have not been very popular to date.</p>

    <p>160 years ago, the newly invented electric telegraph carried the first news message. The message zipped 40 miles in a flash over wires from Baltimore to Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>The public was dazzled — except Henry David Thoreau. He wrote: “We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate.”</p>

<p>Today, we live in a Golden Age of communication. We have the Internet. We have faxes. We have e-mails. We have streaming video. We have on-line audio. We have RSS feeds. We have logs and blogs.</p>

<p>Yet today Thoreau is as right as rain. When it comes to really getting our messages across, we’re stuck in the Stone Age.</p>

<p>Here’s why. The vast majority of business leaders I’ve encountered are repeatedly making a huge mistake in communication, a mistake that’s screwing up their jobs and careers. They’re stuck giving presentations and speeches. They’re NOT giving Leadership Talks!</p>

<p>What’s a Leadership Talk? Look at it this way: There’s a hierarchy of verbal persuasion when it comes to business leadership. The lowest levels are speeches and presentations. They communicate information. The highest, most effective way of communicating is the Leadership Talk. The Leadership Talk does more than simply send information. It has the leader establish a deep, human, emotional connection with the audience. That’s where leaders communicate for the best results.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of leadership talks. When Churchill said, “We will fight on the beaches … ” That was a leadership talk. When Kennedy said, “Ask not what your country can do for you … ” that was a leadership talk. When Reagan said, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” That was a leadership talk.</p>

<p>You can come up with a lot of examples too. Go back to those moments when the words of a leader inspired people to take ardent action, and you’ve probably put your finger on an authentic leadership talk.</p>

<p>Mind you, I’m not just talking about great leaders of history. I’m also talking about all leaders everywhere no matter what their function or rank. After all, leaders speak 15 to 20 times a day: everything from formal speeches to informal chats. When those interactions are leadership talks, not just speeches or presentations, the effectiveness of those leaders is dramatically increased.</p>

<p>That’s where business leaders communicate for the best results. You can order people to go from point A to point B. But the best way to get great results is to have people want to go from A to B. Instilling “want to” in others, motivating them … isn’t that what great leadership is all about?</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. The Leadership Talk is not some kind of “feel-good” way of relating. It took me 20 years to figure out how to give Leadership Talks and write two books about it. There are specific processes one must manifest in order to give Leadership Talks. Usually it takes me two full days to teach people how to do it. Once they learn it, they can use it throughout the rest of their careers. The Leadership Talk is relatively easy to learn and it takes years to master. The point is that through it, you can take specific, concrete steps to motivate people to take action that gets great results.</p>

<p>For instance, before leaders can develop and deliver a Leadership Talk, they must first answer “yes” to three simple questions: “Do you know what the audience needs? Can you transfer your deep believe to others so they believe as strongly as you do about the challenges you face? And can you have that audience take ardent action that gets results?” If leaders “no” to any one of those questions, he/she can’t give a Leadership Talk.</p>

<p>160 years ago the dots and dashes that chattered down the wires from Baltimore to Washington spelled out that the Whigs had nominated Henry Clay to run for the presidency.</p>

<p>Back then, Thoreau might have said nothing important was communicated; but today if you want to lead for great results, take Thoreau to heart. Communicate what truly IS important. Don’t give presentations and speeches. Give Leadership</p>
