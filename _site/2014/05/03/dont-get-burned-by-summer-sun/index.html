    <p>Warm summer days filled with bright sunshine aren’t always good for you. Over exposure to sunlight can cause serious sunburn, pain and the long-term risk of skin cancer. St. John Ambulance, Canada’s leader in safety-oriented™ first aid training and products, points out that you can still enjoy sun if you reduce risk by taking precautions.</p>

<p>People with fair skin are most susceptible to sunburns. However, no matter what the skin type, the harmful effects of the sun, such as sunburn, can be sustained by anyone.</p>

<p>Prevention is your best defense. Use a sunscreen strong enough to block out harmful rays. Remember to apply it liberally many times over the course of a day in the sun as it will soak into skin, evaporate and be washed off in water.</p>

<p>Don’t stay outdoors for extended periods without covering exposed skin. Never leave tender skin exposed for more than a few minutes at a time. Wear a light, sun repellent cover over bathing suits or other light clothing. Always keep your head and eyes protected.</p>

<p>First Aid for sunburn</p>

<p>Sunburns can be very serious. Ranging from mild discomfort to severe burning over a large portion of the body, extreme sunburn can be further complicated by heatstroke. For minor sunburn, St. John Ambulance suggests the following first aid:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Check the casualty thoroughly to determine the extent and severity of the burn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get out of the sun immediately.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cover the burn with a wet towel or gently sponge the area with cool water to relieve pain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pat the skin dry and apply medicated sunburn ointment or lotion. Apply according to directions on the package and watch for warning signs of an allergic reaction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protect burnt areas from further exposure to the sun.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t break blisters – doing so may promote infection. If large areas of the skin begin to blister, seek medical help.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the casualty begins to vomit or develops a fever, give first aid for heatstroke and get medical help.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
