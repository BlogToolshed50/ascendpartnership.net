    <p>Before going on about energy, let’s define it first. Energy may mean a lot of things. In this article, we refer energy as a source of usable power which is obtained from various sources and is converted to electricity for man’s consumption. That’s where the problem comes in. Most people are not aware but we are slowly but surely depleting our energy/resources. So how bad is it really?</p>

<p>Well, let’s cite a few facts: everyday we hear in the news that oil reserves are depleting. Brown/black outs occur frequently, gas prices are increasing, etc. The Americans alone consume twice as much electric power per ca pita than the British, and six times as much as the world average. The U.S. demand for energy is increasing at such a fast rate, doubling every 15 years. In fact, back in 1999, the U.S. consumed 95 quadrillion BTUs of energy but only produced 61 quadrillion BTUs. Do the math, and that’s a 34 quadrillion BTU energy deficit. It does not take a genius to figure out that the rate is alarming.</p>

<p>People want more gasoline to turn the wheels in their cars, more natural gas to heat the homes in winter time and more electricity to cool their houses in the summer. The problem is fairly obvious. We consume more energy than we produce. That’s why we import energy from other countries to keep our lights on and our appliances running. So is it possible for our world to lose all its standard energy/resources? Yes, it is. Geophysicists from the U.S Geological Survey predicted that 90% of all oil and gas will be gone by 2035, and roughly about 90% of all coal will be depleted by 2300. This may sound a long time from now, but the fact is, that day will arrive, and that day is coming. Think about the future of our children and our grand children. That thought alone should open our eyes to do something about it now.</p>

<p>The good news is that experts believe technology can supply more alternate sources of power as time goes by. In the meantime, we must do our parts in conserving energy. Start at home: turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth; turn off the lights and appliances when they are not in use; if you are going somewhere that’s close, try walking instead of driving; improve insulation in private homes; recycle and reuse products that can be turned into something usable again. Not only that: we have renewable energy sources. What’s this? This is the energy we get from the sun, the wind, the water. So we are not so bad off after all if we just tap on the right sources.</p>

<p>Let’s all pitch in. This is our world we are trying to save, our world where we belong, for the future of our children and so on, so forth</p>
