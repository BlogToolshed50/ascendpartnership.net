    <p>While modern medicine claims listening to Johann Sebastian Bach can cure everything from headaches to general anxiety disorder, I believe it is only so if you enjoy J.S. Bach. I tend to enjoy Mozart, The Beatles, and numerous others better. There are certain songs for which I can listen by various artists that put me in a trance-like state. It is when I arrive here that I know I can easily think outside the box.</p>

<p>While music is a great instigator of creativity, nothing beats nature. I am fortunate in that I live on the edge of America’s oldest National Forest, but that was not always the case. Many times, I simply left my house with my dog and we went to the local park to play. Where there is nature such as greenery, trees, in other words, lack of buildings, noise and trees, is a great place to start.</p>

<p>Never leave the house without a pen and paper. You may think you will remember that great idea you had while listening to music, walking in the park of forest or park or even before you went to sleep; but always, and I mean always, keep that pen beside you. Though you may find that the majority of your ideas, as are mine, are useless, its the 10 or so brilliant percent that will take you where you want to be. You will never regret your friends, ink and paper.</p>

<p>Brainstorm, but brainstorm with someone you trust. At times, you may have to give them a piece of the action, depending on how much they have contributed and that is only fair. But sometimes you just need a sounding board to see if you are on the right track, and most close friends or family will do that for you at no cost.</p>

<p>If you are writing a song, poem or series of them, and hit a writers block, find a rhyming dictionary, a dictionary, thesaurus (or they are all online for free). There’s always an answer even if you don’t have it on the tip of your tongue.</p>

<p>If you run into a problem or obstacle write it down or type it into your computer. Just put it someplace where you can see it. Call a trusted friend or family member and let them know you have it typed on your screen and “What would they do” if they were in your situation; or, you may surprise yourself and figure it out on your own.</p>

<p>Take a walk or a hike or a jog. When you return, you’ll either have an answer or you will have forgotten what the issue or problem was in the first place.</p>

<p>Turn off the television, even if you love it. TV does ugly things to the creative brain. That’s not just me talking but many studies.</p>

<p>There can be a lure to take drugs or drink when/if things get tough. Ironically this is when you need that kind of stimulation the least. To you, you may seem to be the most creative person in the world when under the influence…to others you just seem under the influence.</p>

<p>Become a voracious reader. Read especially biographies and autobiographies of persons who have achieved what it is you are trying to accomplished. You might be surprised how much these creators and inventors reveal about themselves and the tricks of the trade.</p>

<p>Argue. That’s right argue. Debate. All of these are “brain exercises”. They do not mean you are attacking someone or questioning their character. By debating other points of view are available to you and it is the perfect brain exercise. The brain is like a muscle. If you are not constantly working, then get with another person or persons and argue or hold a lively conversation. You will come home that much smarter.</p>

<p>Like Walt Disney, if you are embarking up on a creative endeavor, don’t count on the local bank to open its vault to you (though it may). Chances are you will have to have patience, persistence, and</p>

<p>friends support on your side. You are in it for the long haul. You will most likely come across many obstacles. Obstacles are your friends because you will learn from them. Similar incidences may evolve in the future but you will instinctively know how to handle them.</p>

<p>Don’t force it. The more you pursue something the more it runs the other way. That includes fame, money, friends, lovers, wives, husbands…you name it. Just sit back and begin enjoying the process doing little bits on your project at a time. If you have a job, don’t quit it yet. Just spend a few hours a day on your creative venture.</p>
