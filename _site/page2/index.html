    <p>Where is Yesterday? Really where did it go? I mean………….. How can 24hrs just disappear?</p>

<p>Awareness, Education and Responsibility.</p>

<p>One of the best ways that i have found to build a healthy personailty involves understanding yourself and your feelings. This can be achieved through this simple exercise i like to call “Awareness, Education and Responsibility” or “Intentional Seeing”</p>

<p>Awareness</p>

<p>You have to accept yourself for the person you are with good points and bad points with strengths and weaknesses……</p>

<p>….when you learn to develop the ability to stand back and look at yourself “honestly” and to candidly admit to others that you may not be perfect, but you’re all you got.</p>

<p>Maybe then, You will start to enjoy the heightened sense of “Intentional Seeing”</p>

<p>Your Future is in your eyes to see.</p>

<p>Education</p>

<p>Think about this, In order for you to become a Medical Doctor you have to go through some serious “education” likewise in order for you to become a Nurse also requires some “education”.</p>

<p>A Lawyer, A carpenter, A Teacher, A Fireman, A policeman, A Millionaire , An Architect, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Fill in the Blank</p>

<p>You have to think about your future possibilities and the “fact” that your potential is virtually unlimited. You can be the person you want to be. You can set large and small goals and make plans (education) and move step by step progressively toward their realization.</p>

<p>There are no Obstacles to what you can accomplish, Except the ones you created.</p>

<p>And last but not least…..</p>

<p>……Responsibility</p>

<p>You have to develop a perspective of what is causing you Unhappiness, then stand back from the situation and imagine the same thing happening to someone you love.</p>

<p>What advice will you give that person?</p>

<p>You know what ?</p>

<p>“If the mind can conceive it then you can achieve it”</p>

<p>I hope you are Responsible!</p>

<p>Be good.</p>

  </header>

    <p>At the school, the child will learn to be submissive to any mortal authority, whether they are in the right or the wrong. At the church, the child will learn to be submissive to the immortal lord, whether the words of the Bible turn his stomach or not. And at home, the child will learn to become a prisoner, he will learn to associate those walls of his parents’ house with the walls of a prison, and he will learn to regard his time until his 18th birthday as a prison sentence. This is no way to raise children, but it is what every child is taught. Those prejudices which are instilled in the human mind from the earliest of ages are the most difficult to remove ever. The child concedes to himself, that the suffering he feels, holding the lies in his mind that he is inferior to adults, believing that his opinions should never be considered, he loses his soul, and becomes a ghost. Years will pass, as this truth gains more root in his mind, and he will grow up to be a consumer. His opinions will be determined by the television programs he watches, he will vote for the same political party that his parents did, his understanding of emotions will be infantile, and finally, he will commit the greatest betrayal, by teaching his children in the way he was taught. He will harness the whip before he touches his son in kindness, he will tell his son “respect your elders,” “mind your parents,” “listen to your teachers.” He will regard every divergent ideal held by his child as a dictator regards dissent: it is to be crushed, but not just crushed, the child must know that his belief to dream of a better life is in vain, that he will never go where he wants to, and that the problem is not with the world but with him. So it happens… The process is started again. The child, who had seen blue skies and the beauty of nature, would dream one day that maybe he can paint a picture that will tell their story. But as he is continually told that disagreement with his father is the equivalent of disrespect, that his dreams are the equivalent of certain failure, that happiness cannot exist unless it is at the command of an adult… as he learns this, his one true possession, his soul, begins to whither. Like the most pure rose, but then water being withheld from it, it rots. The longer it is removed from what it needs, the less likely it will ever possibly recover. Thus, we have the system of education in which the children of our world learn and develop.</p>

<p>A man will not afford the rights to his own child, that he would afford to any other man in the world. And it is this, which I regard as the greatest treachery of all history. Tell me the tale of the worst treason in the world, of the most infamous and vile traitor, and his story will dim in comparison to the poverty of spirituality that is given to children today. Among almost all of our schools, it is a violation of the rules to call a teacher by their first name. Think of that! There can be no doubt that the authors of these rules are not the children, for whom they are made for, but rather the teachers and school administration. Here we have the basic premises that every Totalitarian regime operates upon: the leaders are not chosen by the public, but they argue that it is for the public’s own good. There is not one iota of involvement of the public in the governing of the affairs of the nation. Liberty is a quality that exists in the dreams of those who refused to sell their soul so they could fill their stomachs. When any person looks back to the rules imposed in an elementary school, we are baffled that we once lived under such heinous conditions. There is an almost universal rule, that gum cannot be chewed during class. Had you offered some to a child, they may speak, “But it is against the rules!” with such force, that you would be convinced that there is no purpose to school, but to brainwash children. Here, when we find that children are so unquestioningly devoted to the rules given to them, we know that they have believed the lies given to them by their oppressors. The true battle for liberation must come when children are not taught to respect every adult, but to respect their own reasoning abilities. Children are not allowed, by penalty of law and government (of which, I have personally seen people convicted and sentenced to jail), to leave their schools. If education is freedom, how is it accompanied by the essential components of slavery?</p>

<p>I will say this much… The school, the church, and the home — all of which promote the idea to respect your parents — every one of these organizations works in unison, to keep the mind of the child of poverty, and to keep the heart of the child in slavery. By oppressing the natural desire of a child’s emotion, to seek out the good, the beautiful, and the gentle, the school system effectively manages to turn them into submissive adults. Not only will they submit to the authorities, but they will submit to social dogmas. They will be afraid to admit how they feel, they will be afraid to say what they think, and they will be afraid to question what they believe. The destruction of society begins with the school system, as it teaches children that life’s greatest pain is to think — that “happiness can only come in the form we give it to you” — our children are taught that every dream, every emotion, every thought, every idea that stirs the soul to contentedness, every tranquil moment that brings joy is fake. This is no way to raise children, no way to love them, and certainly, it is no way to educate them.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2016/01/05/six-reasons-to-learn-logic/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Six Reasons to Learn Logic</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>In Star Trek, there’s the purely logical guy, Mr. Spock, and the purely emotional guy, who is just about any other character. Real life isn’t like that–we need to be able to function both ways, with our minds and with our emotions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, learning logical thinking doesn’t just come naturally for most people. But it’s an important skill. Logic traps are everywhere.</p>

<p>Here’s what you can do about it: teach logic to your child. Why?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Your child will be able to understand cause and effect, and make better life choices. For instance, a child who understands logical consequences will be more able to counter the voices of “friends” who urge him to misuse his money and his time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your child will be a good problem-solver. Good problem-solving involves coming up with a list of options to consider. This will help later on in a range of situations, from how to deal with a plugged-up sink to what to do about a car that breaks down.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your child will be better prepared to challenge advertising. He will be able to identify fallacies such as circular reasoning. For example, an advertiser might tell us, “Happy folks buy Toasty Puffs.” What he means is, “Buy Toasty Puffs, and you’ll be happy!” This is circular logic! Can your child recognize it?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your child will be able to carefully consider persuasion from politicians and the media. What if a TV reporter interviews five people who say the US should allow illegal immigrants to stay? Then the reporter concludes that everyone in the state wants illegal immigrants to stay. What is the problem here? This is an error in generalizing from too small a sample group. The reporter needs opinions from a much wider sample group. Can your child see the error?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your child will be able to evaluate what someone says by looking at who said it. For instance, if your dentist tells you how to take care of your teeth, you should follow his advice-he’s an expert. But if he tells you how to fix your car, you might not consider him an expert on that!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your child will be able to understand how computers think. Computers think in ways: if statement A is true, then do action B. Otherwise, do action C. Our brains tend to skip around in comparison. But learning to program a computer to follow a logical sequence helps the child learn to think logically, too. In the Information Age, this is a very useful skill to develop, now or later. The more your child knows about computers, the more he will be master of that device that is mastering our lives.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2015/12/04/developing-an-e-commerce-strategy/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Developing an e-Commerce Strategy</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>One bright spot on the economic horizons around the world seems to be continued consumer spending and e-commerce is clearly a part of this, with sales estimated to be in excess of $9.9 billion in the next three months according to ACNielsen. But there is a dark cloud hovering over this sunny e-commerce landscape called poor web site design. Let’s explore some of the reasons why consumers are not reaching for their credit cards after perusing an e-commerce web site.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>There is a huge knowledge gap about how the web is really driving online and offline commerce. A recent e-CommercePulse survey of more than 33,000 surfers conducted by Nielsen/Net ratings and Harris Interactive indicates e-commerce sites are driving more purchases offline (phone, catalog, retail store sales) than online. Many consumers are using the web to effortlessly compare features and pricing, then calling the company or visiting their local retail store to make a purchase. Clearly many companies need to factor this information in when analyzing their online and offline marketing expenditures and related ROI.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to a recent Research and Keynote Systems Report released earlier this summer, over $25 Billion (USD) was lost in e-commerce due to users abandoning the web site prior to a purchase being made or during the process. The users just gave up because the load times (the amount of time it takes a page # to be displayed in a browser) were painfully slow. Today’s online shoppers aren’t a real patient group; they want information presented in 12-18 seconds or they are off to another site that works.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p># Unfortunately, many firms have allocated a disproportionate amount of resources for advertising and not enough on good web site design and back-end infrastructure. It’s critical to make the market aware of a site, but if the potential customers are not presented with the right navigation and menus (read information architecture), they will not buy. Case in point: according to recent Dataquest surveys (and others), between 20-40% of most users don’t purchase because they can’t figure out how to easily move around the web site.</p>

<p># Many firms fail to properly integrate their e-commerce components with the overall site design. The in-house developers or the outside design firm concentrate on the sexy parts of the web site design process (the graphics, branding, look and feel) and only focus on the e-commerce process after the primary web site design is completed, making e-commerce an afterthought.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A large number of e-commerce web sites don’t even list a phone number, arbitrarily forcing people to contact the company electronically, This is a real problem, as many people don’t want to use e-mail or forms as their primary means of communicating. They want the immediacy of the telephone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s very surprising, but approximately 30% of e-commerce sites don’t have a search capability that actually works. In many cases it just returns gobblygook. This is a real irritant for many online shoppers who want to find goods and services quickly and efficiently. The need for speed should be the e-commerce merchant’s marketing mantra and a good search capability gives users a way to quickly find products.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most important parts of any web site is the home or index page, as it aggregates the design elements and information architecture. So many index pages are cluttered and poorly designed, loaded with poor graphics, bad menu structures, oddball words, or my absolute least favorite … 30-60 second Flash animation sequences which force the user to sit and stare at a blank screen while the animation loads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Privacy statements are about as exciting as filing taxes (unless you know you’re getting a refund). They are out of necessity filled with legal terminology that needs to be addressed succinctly and in a way that makes a consumer feel comfortable about doing business with an e-commerce web site. Unfortunately, many e-commerce web site privacy statements look like an afterthought, or are so “attorney driven” (three pages – who has time to read this?) that people are turned off by them. It’s very important that a privacy statement be a compromise document brokered between legal and marketing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are a full service ad agency so I don’t mind shooting arrows in the direction of my peers. Too much attention is being placed on web site advertising metrics (click-through rates, certified traffic to substantiate ad rates, etc.) and not enough on how people find and use an e-commerce web site. The industry standard web site analysis tool is Web Trends, but one of the least understood aspects of this product is tracking how people find and move around a web site via reports which can be pulled from the server log files; i.e., where did the visitors come from, what pages do they visit, how long do they stay, what are their traffic patterns, etc.? e-Commerce companies should be analyzing these “digital customer tracks” to better understand how to improve their front-end marketing processes and back-end web site design.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

    <p>In speaking of comparison we need to be aware that we should never compare ourselves to others. No other person has our unique qualities. No one else has ever gone through the exact same circumstances or has had the precise physical characteristics or thoughts we have. We are each unique in our own special way.</p>

<p>When we compare ourselves to others we give away a small part of our uniqueness, taking away from our own gifts and talents. We honor others for what they have achieved and for their talents and characteristics and should expect them to honor us in return.</p>

<p>It is when we are envious of others and what they possess that we do the greatest damage to ourselves. If we only knew what their thoughts were and what they had gone through to achieve their success it is unlikely we would want anything to do with it.</p>

<p>Wise persons of the ages have stated that if all people in the whole world were to dump their problems in one pile and we were to go through that pile, we would be extremely happy to settle for our own problems.</p>

<p>We just don’t know what the other person feels until we have been in his shoes. What does he think and why does he think that way? What circumstances has he been through? What obstacles has he had to overcome to achieve whatever it is that he has achieved?</p>

<p>When we can truthfully answer those questions we can know how the other persons feels and what has been required of him. The one thing we can know is our own thoughts and feelings, the circumstances we have allowed to bring us to our current position in life, and the choices we have made to bring us to where we are.</p>

<p>This allows us to honor others without comparing ourselves to them. And we should rightfully expect others to extend the same consideration to us.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2015/10/06/rules-of-data-backups/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Rules Of Data Backups</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Backups of company data are carried out for two main reasons. The first is to cater for those times when a document is inadvertently deleted or damaged and you wish to recover the original document; the second is as part of a disaster recovery plan in case something catastrophic happens to your computers (e.g., victims of a fire or theft).</p>

<p>Backups cost time, money and effort to implement, and they are of no value right up until the time you need them. This means they tend to be given a low priority, but ultimately they may easily represent the difference between your business surviving and failing. In this Tip-Sheet, we look at the most common mistakes businesses make with backups.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Backup often</li>
</ol>

<p>Re-entering data is tedious and frustrating. Backing up your company data once a week means that the most you should ever have to re-input is one week’s worth Backing up your company data once a day means the most you should ever have to re-input is one day’s worth. Frequent backups lessen the impact of data loss.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Don’t keep any volatile data on desktop PCs</li>
</ol>

<p>In many organisations, documents are kept on the hard drive of desktop PCs. It is unlikely that this is backed up regularly, if at all. A PC can easily be replaced: last week’s quotations may not be so easy to replace. In particular, check that email is not stored on the local hard drive (this is very common in small to medium size businesses). All documents, spreadsheets, email, etc should be kept on a central server, which is in turn backed up regularly.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Automate the backup process</li>
</ol>

<p>Backups are tedious to do. At 6:30pm, most people would prefer to set off home or join colleagues in the bar rather than stay in the office to find the correct tape and start a backup. Automating tedious tasks means they get done.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Monitor the backup process</li>
</ol>

<p>While automating backups is a good idea, do check that they are running correctly. Make sure new files are being backed up; make sure the files of new users are being backed up. A quick check once a week could avert a much more serious problem later.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Keep backups off-site</li>
</ol>

<p>If your business premises suffer a fire or flood, it is likely that backup media will be lost as well. Fireproof safes only protect media for a given time, typically one hour – if you use one, check the manufacturer’s specification. If you always keep your backup tape in the server then when it is stolen the thief will probably throw the tape away. It’s worth nothing to him, but it could represent bankruptcy to you.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Produce a “backup recovery” manual</li>
</ol>

<p>A major disaster is not the time to try to remember how to recover data from your backup media. Have an idiot-proof, step-by-step procedure written – with a copy stored off-site – detailing how to reinstate your company data.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Test the recovery procedure periodically</li>
</ol>

<p>Without warning, give the backup recovery manual to a member of staff and see how long it takes them to recover data. Many organizations never do this! No one involved with creating the manual or the backups themselves should be involved in the test. The results of the test should be analyzed and the manual updated accordingly. A recovery test should be carried out at least twice a year. This proves both that the backups themselves are usable, and that your organization understands how to use them if necessary.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2015/09/14/living-your-successful-life/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Living your successful life</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Living your successful life requires you to step out. I remember as a teenager, right out of high school, learning this valuable lesson. Now – 15 years later – my life is the result of habitually stepping out.</p>

<p>The scene is Naval Recruit Training Center in San Diego, Ca. There I am, standing poker-straight in a line with some 15 other recruits as the Southern California sun tans our young faces.</p>

<p>“I need a volunteer,” shouts the drill instructor. “Take one step forward!” The first thing you’re taught in boot camp is never volunteer for anything. Of course, I wasn’t very good at conforming and stepped right out.</p>

<p>The drill instructor approached. Standing nose to nose with me, he stated in a quiet “Dirty Harry” kind of voice “Pollock, do you know only true leaders step out front?”</p>

<p>John F. Kennedy, echoing Theodore Roosevelt, stated the idea more eloquently when he said:</p>

<p>“The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who at best, if he wins, knows the thrills of high achievement, and, if he fails, at least fails daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.”</p>

<p>Living your life on your terms means stepping out on a regular basis. You have a song in your heart. Will you step out from the crowd and sing that song? Will you risk appearing the fool to live your dreams?</p>

<p>It may seem frightening and lonely to step out front. It is, but only for a short time. The comfort of conformity soon pales in comparison to the power, passion and excitement that comes with any bold, new, purposeful action.</p>

<p>You’ll soon find others who’ve stepped out front with you. They’re people like you who’ve grown weary of living a mediocre existence. They – like you – will have heeded the whisper of God within, which quietly says “It’s your life. Make it great.”</p>

<p>Step out front this week. It doesn’t have to be a big step. Maybe you’ve been thinking about starting your own home based business. Perhaps you have an idea for your own newsletter. Maybe there’s a class you’ve been wanting to take. Whatever it is, take your first step this week.</p>

<p>If you’re not sure what that first step is for you, shoot me a message and we’ll come up with it together.</p>

<p>Step out and have a great week!</p>

<p>It’s your life! Create it the way you want</p>
