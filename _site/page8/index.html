  </header>

    <p>Many of us are looking to ancient or traditional teachings to guide us in today’s ever changing world. One topic that often comes up is that of forgiveness. On a Dr. Phil show I recently viewed while channel surfing, I saw a guest on the show telling Dr. Phil, “I’ll forgive him, but I’ll never forget.” And as she said it, she was clearly hanging on to negative emotions. Does that sound like true forgiveness to you?</p>

<p>Like all of us, I’ve experienced painful relationships or situations in my life that made me question whether I should forgive the other person or not. But one truth I learned from my lineage of Huna is that there is only one person that you hurt by holding onto feelings of unforgiveness — and that is you.</p>

<p>My kumu (teacher) explained to me that there were three types of “wrongs” in ancient times in Hawaii. These three wrongs– hala, hewa and ino –were a part of the code of forgiveness practiced in many parts of the islands. Hala is to miss the path, or err by omission. Haven’t we all missed the path at some time or other? I have. Often it was crossing a boundary without understanding that I had done so, or neglecting to do something out of ignorance. The wrong called hewa is to go overboard or to do to in excess. I’ve certainly been guilty here as well, especially when I become passionate about a topic and express my enthusiasm without considering others. Ino, the third wrong, is to do harm intentionally to either self or others. Most of us would claim that we’ve never intentionally hurt another, but what about ourselves? Personally, I know that I’ve judged and criticized myself, saying cruel things to myself that I would never say to another.</p>

<p>In all these wrongs, forgiveness was required in ancient Hawai’i. It was required because the Hawaiians knew that holding onto negativity causes harm to the one who won’t forgive. This does not conflict with wise discernment, knowing when the one causing harm is not to be trusted. As another kumu says, “First time shame on you, second time shame on me.” But my grandfather also used say, “When you point a finger at someone to blame them, there are always three fingers pointing back at you.” In other words, you may have more to do with the problem than you know.</p>

<p>So how do we balance our approach to forgiveness. How do we (1) forgive, (2) release the negativity, and (3) still learn from the event?</p>

<p>The process I use and teach comes, which literally means to make something doubly pono. Though pono is a word that does not have a specific English translation, the closest word is right, but not as in “you are right and I am wrong.” Pono is the feeling of congruency and calmness that we’ve all experienced at some point. That sense that everything feels “right,” like feeling so at peace with a person or situation that nothing needs to be said.</p>

<p>To take the first step, we need to rethink the process of forgiveness. In western thinking, when we do a wrong, whether hala, hewa, we tend to say “I’m sorry.” However, an apology is only one-sided, a statement that asks for no response from the one harmed. Huna understands that it takes two to tango. So the first step is to ask for forgiveness then for the other to give forgiveness.</p>

<p>For instance, I’ve had heated arguments with people that definitely required an apology at the end. But it’s like a meal that doesn’t last: Within a short time after all the apologies and making-up, either I or the other person brings it up again “This is just like the last time….” So even though we were sorry, we weren’t done and complete. Getting to pono is different. When you are pono with someone, nothing else needs to be said or done. You are right with one another.</p>

<p>To become truly pono with someone, you first ask for and offer forgiveness for anything you may have done. Though I’ve had situations when I didn’t really think I’d done anything wrong, I still must say “please forgive me too” to complete the process. Saying, “I forgive you; please forgive me too” brings the other person into the picture and gets them actively involved. Rather than merely “being sorry,” a two-way street of forgiveness is formed.</p>

<p>Next, allow the space for you and the other person to say everything that needs to be said. Unburden yourself and say it all. Express what needs to be expressed without hiding or holding back. When you have both shared your thoughts and feelings, you should experience a sense of “I have said it all, and I am done.” Once again, give and ask for forgiveness from one another. Receive it and give it.</p>

<p>Finally, move forward. Huna says that we must learn from all of our experiences in life. So once you are pono, ask yourself: What do I need to learn from this event that will allow me to continue to be pono? Learning is positive, about the self and future based. Take this learning with you to help you change your behavior and thinking, make better decisions, and to create the relationships and situations you desire. And though other difficult times may occur again, once you are pono, you won’t bring baggage from the past into new difficulties. You will begin new interactions from a place of being pono, and with the insight from the learning you received.</p>

<p>To forgive and to never forget is to never forgive in the first place. Holding on to the negativity and even the memory of the negativity prevents true forgiveness and only hurts you. We owe it to ourselves to experience true forgiveness</p>

  </header>

    <p>This is the era of technology. Everyday a new discovery, a new invention is being made. The world is moving ahead in leaps and bounds. People are striving for success and satisfaction in life in the face of fierce competition. Competition is ubiquitous- in every walk, every aspect of life right from childhood to old age. No one escapes competition.</p>

<p>It’s very essential to know the effects- both positive and negative- of competition on society. Competition is the very force that drives individuals to aim for goals, aim higher. In school, students compete against each other for higher grades. Athletes compete for more wins, more records. Companies vie against each other for better sales, bigger markets. Just because there is competition, a person is forced to work harder, better and efficiently to overcome it, to defeat it.</p>

<p>Healthy competition is very important for the overall development of individuals, communities and nations on a broader perspective. Take the Indian car industry for instance. It remained stagnant till the late 80′s with only 2 companies offering the same cars for 3 decades. Once the economic reforms came, many companies came into fray and competition increased. In the face of competition, new models, new features, better performing cars are being produced constantly. All this ultimately benefits the customer who gets a wider range to make a choice from. The same example can be applied in every other industry. Competition can only give a thrust to progress. No one can afford to be complacent and sit with fingers crossed. It will only leave one behind in the race. Competition expects and promotes fresh thinking, new ideas, better and more hard work. It makes one sit up and take notice of the world around. As someone aptly said,’there is no business without competition.’</p>

<p>Competition in a positive and healthy way is the road to progress. But the moment it is used in a negative way, it can prove harmful. We see the use of performance enhancing drugs in sports- athletes being banned and so on. Companies indulge in malpractice like accounts tampering, publishing false reports to up their stocks.</p>

<p>A most apt example to conclude the discussion- This is a story from the heights of competition for supremacy in space between Americans and the Soviets. US astronauts faced difficulty to write with ball point or any other pens in space. NASA spent 12 million dollars and a few years developing a pen which could write anywhere on any surface without any problems. When relations became friendlier, soviet cosmonauts were asked what they used. The answer-a pencil.</p>

<p>Competition is ultimately more beneficial than detrimental to society, only if indulged in a healthy way. Unhealthy competition will only lead to destruction of faith, goodwill in society.</p>

  </header>

    <p>This is story of a girl. A girl supposed to have a very soft heart. A very sensitive girl. Someone one could call as a compassionate person. Look at these hearts. She was as soft as these hearts and as beautiful as these flowers. This story is that of a transformation. This talks of howw a flower changes to a killer thorn. Let me begin. I will tell you about how she acquired her pet, rather two pets. And how one was beaten by her father and the other was beaten dead by herself..</p>

<p>She had gone to visit one of her relatives many years back. They had a litter of puppies. This girl fell in love with one of them and brought him back with her, only to face the wrath of her father. She was ordered to take the puppy back. This was a big shock and she was in tears. She talked about this with her other pet. A man. Someone she treated as her own child. They both cried together and this man prayed that the father allows her to keep her puppy. Ultimately the father relented after two days and all was well.</p>

<p>One day some guests came to their home. The dog was tied and locked separately. But the dog wrongly thought that he was part of the family and wanted to mingle with the guests. The dog made a blunder by thinking like this. The family was not even of humans, nor of animals. Because even animals have compassion. These people belonged to some unknown cruel specie. True to character, the father took hold of the poor helpless dog and beat him blue. May Satan bless the father. Our girl of the story was heart-broken after this. She could not believe that her father could behave so cruelly.</p>

<p>Next what? I told you in the beginning about a man, who was a pet of this girl. Do you recollect? Now was the turn of the girl. She made the man fall in total love with her and become totally dependent, emotionally. And one fine day, she started beating this man. Like the dog, this man was shocked and could not believe it. So he went to the girl again thinking of their love. He was beat up again. This continued till the man turned a lunatic and was killed in all the ways.</p>

<p>After reading this story, will you have any faith left in words such as love, loyalty, truth, honesty, etc? Beware of humans. They turn into beasts. Befriend beasts. Because they always remain only beasts. They don’t turn into something else. They will never turn a person into a lunatic.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2013/11/25/day-dreaming-your-way-to-prosperity/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Day dreaming your way to prosperity!</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Can you day dream your way to prosperity? It’s an interesting thought and it sounds so easy. One of my mentors Randy Gage talks about prosperity – what is it and what is it not? Some people may think that prosperity is all about money. I have come to realize that this is not the case.</p>

<p>There are probably a lot of rich people in the world who are very unhappy; they may have a life full of riches and material things but they may not be happy. Prosperity is all about abundance; it could be an abundance of friends or spiritual well-being.</p>

<p>However, if you’re on the bread line and can’t afford to eat, then of course you’re not going to be prosperous, even if you have lots of friends and are in touch with your spirituality. It is of course about money too but it’s important to have a balance.</p>

<p>So how can day dreaming help?</p>

<p>This is really fun as you need to be able to dream big. Think of all the things that you would like out of life. Don’t worry about how you’re going to get them or achieve them at the moment. There are different ways to document your dreams and goals and you need to choose the one that is right for you.</p>

<p>Napoleon Hill in his book “Think and Grow Rich” advises you to write a statement of what you want to achieve by when, and what you’re going to give in return. He states that desire is the starting point of all achievement. Once you have written this statement you need to read it out loud twice a day with emotion. Once in the morning and once before you go to bed. By doing this you are applying the principle of auto suggestion for the purpose of giving orders to your subconscious mind.</p>

<p>Another way, as suggested by Randy Gage is to writing a script of your perfect day. Write it as if you’re writing a movie script. Just imagine yourself waking up in the morning – where are you, what does your house look like, who are you with. Do you go for a walk on the beach? Do you reach your sales target for the year? Write this in great detail then keep the script with you so when you have a spare moment you can read it and remind yourself.</p>

<p>You can also create a dream board. This is really a fun thing to do. You can create a dream board or a dream book or a dream wheel, whichever works for you. Sit down and gather lots of magazines around you. Look for images of things that you would really like. Would you like a silver Jaguar, or a red Mercedes? What sort of house do you want to live in? Would you like a swimming pool or a hot tub?</p>

<p>Just dream big and cut out all the pictures, stick the pictures on your dream board. Now put this somewhere prominent where you look at it every day. I have it on my office wall, so I look at when I’m at my PC. I’ve heard a lot of examples where people have moved house and put their dream board away. They’ve unpacked it several years later and they realize that they are living in the house that was on their dream board!</p>

<p>If you look at the pictures every day your dreams will manifest into reality. To make your dreams come true you must first be able to visualize them. The ideas above give a few ways for you to easily do that.</p>

<p>One important thing is that you have to believe. If you’re looking at your dream board and thinking negative thoughts – such as “How on earth am I going to ever be able to afford that car, it’s never going to happen to me” then it probably won’t happen. You need to think positive thoughts about achieving your dreams. Don’t worry about ‘the how’ just believe and it will happen. For example, I don’t really known how exactly electricity works when I switch on a light, but I know that it works and that’s all that matters.</p>

<p>Prosperity is something that can be achieved by all of us and dreaming will certainly help you to get there. As I work from home I enjoy learning about all these topics as personal development is a key to success. I recently saw a quote from Michael Flynne “If you can dream it you can do it”. I’m certainly willing to give it a try, if it can help me on my journey to wealth. It’ll also be lots of fun on the way!</p>

  </header>

    <p>Research into weight loss aids and supplements have always left me curious about the many benefits of green tea dieting. In this article I hope to mention some of the main benefits of green tea dieting. Although it’s not a diet per say, it involves drinking green tea with your meals, or alternatively, supplementing with green tea extract capsules. But just what is it that makes green tea so effective?</p>

<p>The occurrence of an anti-oxidant is one of the greatest benefits of green tea dieting. Researchers were puzzled for years as to why the French have relatively few heart diseases even though they eat a diet rich in fat. It turned out that the answer lied in red wine, which contains a chemical that reduces the negative effects of high-fat meals and smoking.</p>

<p>Studies later showed that the chemical found in red wine is only half as powerful as EGCG, this is another one of the huge benefits of green tea dieting. Heart disease is quite low among men In Japan, even though around 75% smoke, but because the Japanese drink green tea regularly, they can get away with it with far fewer consequences your typical Americans can, in a similar way to the French.</p>

<p>You may be wondering why consuming other teas in your diet do not have the same benefits of green tea dieting. This is because green tea is processed differently. While black and oolong tea leaves are oxidized through fermentation, green tea leaves are steamed, preventing the loss of anti-oxidants, which is why we have so many benefits of green tea dieting.</p>

<p>According to researchers one of the benefits of green tea dieting is the triggering of weight loss by helping the body burn additional calories and lowering your level of body fat. In the January 2006 issue of The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition a study was published showing those who had tea fortified with green tea extract every day for three months lost more body fat than those who drank oolong tea, proving the effectiveness of green tea in comparison to other teas.</p>

<p>Other research shows that another one of the biggest benefits of green tea dieting is that it helps you fight the flu by boosting your system’s immunity against viruses. Green tea has a substance in it that makes the certain cells in your body output 10 times the normal amount of interferon, which is what fights the virus. However, there are still many other benefits of green tea dieting.</p>

<p>There also exists solid evidence that shows that the benefits of green tea dieting includes a reduction of bladder, colon, esophageal, pancreas, rectum and stomach cancer by as much as 60%. What’s more, EGCG has been reported to be 100 times more effective than vitamin C and at least 25 times more effective than vitamin E at protecting cells. This is also one of the biggest benefits of green tea dieting.</p>

<p>Yet another one of the benefits of green tea dieting comes from studies in Britain which show that green tea can help slow the process of Alzheimer’s disease by inhibiting chemicals in the brain responsible for plaque and protein deposits in the gray matter of your head. It is these deposits which hinder the ability to think clearly.</p>

<p>Simply put, the lists of benefits of green tea dieting are too many to mention, and are supported with evidence too. Regardless of whether weight loss is a priority, I always recommend individuals drink green tea or take green tea pills regularly. Based on the many studies on the benefits of green tea dieting I recommend at least 3-5 cups a day.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Personality is the sum total of the ways in which an individual reacts to and interacts with others. It is most often described in terms of measurable traits that a person exhibits.</p>

<p>Personality Determinants</p>

<p>An adult’s personality is generally considered to be made up both hereditary and environmental factors, moderated by situational conditions.</p>

<p>Heredity Heredity refers to those factors that were determined at conception. Physical stature, facial attractiveness gender, temperament, muscle composition, and reflexes, energy level, and biological rhythms are characteristics that are generally considered to be either completely or substantially influenced by who your parents were, that is, by their biological, physiological, and inherent psychological make up.</p>

<p>Tree different streams of research lend some credibility to the argument that heredity plays an important part in determining an individual personality. The first look at the genetic underpinning of human behavior and temperament among young children. The second address the study of twins who were separated at birth. The third examines the consistency in job satisfaction over time and across situation.</p>

<p>Environment Among the factors that exert pressures on our personality formation are the culture in which we are raised, our early conditioning, the norms among our family, friends, and social groups, and other influences that we experience. The environment which we are exposed plays substantial role in shaping our personality.</p>

<p>For example, culture establishes the norms, attitudes, and values that are passed along from the generation to the next and create consistencies over time.</p>

<p>Situation A third factor, the situation, influences the effects of heredity and environment on personality. An individual’s personality, although generally stable and consistent, does change in different situations.</p>

<p>It seems only logical to suppose that situations will influence an individual’s personality, but a neat classification scheme that would tell us the impact of various types of situations has so far eluded us. Apparently we are not yet close to the developing a system for clarifying situations so they might be systematically studied. How ever we do know that certain situations are more relevant than others in influencing personality.</p>

<p>Personality Traits</p>

<p>The early work on the structure of personality revolved around attempts to identify and label enduring characteristics that describes an individual behavior. Popular characteristics include shyness, aggressiveness, submissiveness, laziness, ambition, loyalty, and timidity. These characteristics, when they are exhibited in a large number of situations, are called personality traits.</p>

<p>In the recent years, an impressive body of research supports that five basic dimensions underlie all others and encompass most of the significant variation in human personality.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Extraversion This dimension captures one’s comfort level with relationship. Extroverts tend to be gregarious, assertive, and sociable. Introverts tend to be reserved, timid, and quiet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agreeableness This dimension refers to an individual’s propensity to defer to others. Highly agreeable people are cooperative, war, and trusting. People who score low in agreeableness are cold, disagreeable, and antagonistic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conscientiousness This dimension is a measure of reliability. A highly conscious person is responsible, organized, dependable, and persistent. Those who score low in this dimension are easily distracted, disorganized, and unreliable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Emotional stability This dimension taps a person’s ability to withstand stress. People with positive emotional stability tend to be calm, self-confident, and secure. Those with highly negative scores tend to be nervous, anxious, depressed, and insecure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Openness to experience The final dimension addresses an individual’s range of interest and fascination with novelty. Extremely open people are creative, curious, and artistically sensitive. Those at the other end of the openness category are conventional and find comfort in the familiar.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Major personality attributes</p>

<p>We want to evaluate more carefully specific personality attributes that have been found to be powerful predictors of behavior in organizations. The first is related to where a person perceives the locus of control, self steem, self monitoring, and propensity for risk taking.</p>

<p>Locus of control some people believe that they are masters of their own fate. Other people see themselves as pawns of fate, believing that what happens to them in their lives is due to luck and chance. the first type who believe that they control their destinies, have been labeled internals, whereas the later, who see their lives as being controlled by outside forces, have been called externals. A person’s perception of the source of his or her fate is turned locus of control.</p>

<p>a large amount of research comparing internals with externals has consistently shown that individuals who have high scores in externality are less satisfied with their job, have higher absenteeism rates, are more alienated from the work setting, and are less involved on their jobs than are internals.</p>

<p>The overall evidence indicates that internals generally perform better on their jobs, but that conclusion should be moderated to reflect differences in jobs. Internals search more effectively for information before making decision, are more motivated to achieve, and make a greater attempt to control their environment. Externals, however, are more complaint and willing to follow directions.</p>

<p>Self-steem people differ in the degree to which they like or dislike themselves. This trait is called self-steem. Self-steem, is directly related to expectation for success. High SEs believe that they possess the ability they need in order to succeed at work.</p>

<p>Individuals with high self-steem will take more risks in job selection and are more likely to choose unconventional jobs than people with low self-steem. The most generalizable finding on self-steem is that low SEs are more susceptible to external influence than are high SEs. Low SEs dependon the receipt of positive evaluation from others. As a result, they are more likely to seek approval from others and more prone to conform to the beliefs and behavior of those they respect than are high SEs.</p>

<p>Self-monitoring it refers to an individual’s ability to adjust his or her behavior to external, situational factors.</p>

<p>Individuals with high in self-monitoring show considerable adaptability in adjusting their behavior to external situational factors. They are highly sensitive to external cues and can behave differently in different situations. High self-monitors are capable of presenting sticking contradictions between their public persona and their private self. Low self-monitors can’t disguise themselves in that way. They need to display their true dispositions and attitudes in every situation; hence, there is high behavioral consistency between who they are and what they do.</p>

<p>Risk taking people differ in their willingness to take chances. This propensity to assume or avoid risk has been shown to have an impact on how long it takes managers to make a decision and how much information they require before making their choice. High risk taking managers make more rapid decisions and use less information in making their choices than do low risk-taking managers.</p>

<p>Personality and National Culture</p>

<p>Do personality frameworks, transfer across cultures? The personality factors identified appear in almost all cross-cultural studies. There are no common personality types for a given country. You can, for instance, find high and low risk takers in almost any culture. Yet a country culture influences the dominant personality characteristics of its population.</p>

<p>Achieving Personality Fit</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, organizations were concerned with personality primarily because they wanted to match individuals to specific jobs. That concern still exists. But, in recent years, interest has expanded to include the individual- organization fit. Why? Because managers today are less interested in applicant’s ability to perform a specific job than with his or her flexibility to meet changing situations.</p>

<p>The Person-Job Fit</p>

<p>In the discussion of personality attributes, our conclusion were often qualified or recognize that the requirements of job moderated the relationship between possession of the personality characteristic and job performance.</p>

<p>The Person Organization Fit</p>

<p>As previously noted, attention in recent years has expanded to include matching people to organizations as well as jobs. To the degree that an organization faces a dynamic and changing environment and requires employees who are able to readily change tasks and move fluidly between teams, it’s probably more important that employees, personalities fit with overall organization’s culture than with the characteristics of any specific jobs.</p>

<p>The person-organization fit essentially argues that people leave jobs that are not compatible with their personality. Using the big five terminology, for instance, we could expect that people high in extra-version fit better with aggressive and team-oriented cultures; people high on agreeableness will match up with supportive organizational climate than one that focuses on aggressiveness; and that people high on openness to experience fit into organizations that emphasize innovation rather than standardization.</p>

  </header>

    <p>With such a fantastic device as the digital camera for the recreation of magic in arts, a lot of care needs to be taken so as to maintain the perfection of the end product. This perfection is not only obtained by the artistic feeling of the photographer but also with the intricate knowledge of every minute aspect of the medium of creation of art (in this case the digital camera). And these minute aspects play a vast role in defining the ultimate perfection. The digital camera, light and depth of field are one such factor that would come into light in this subsequent discussion. Basically, the depth of field is a measurement of the acceptable sharpness. Yet this is very strictly a personal preference, and varies from person to person. Thus to be more formal, the depth of field can be defined as the area inside an image that demonstrates an ample sharpness that can be considered more or less in focus. So the depth of field is the range of distance, measured along the lens axis, as per which the image is caused to be sufficiently well and sharp in the photograph. The rest is as follows!</p>

<p>The depth of field defines the zone where all elements show clearly from foreground to background. Three factors control the depth of field in an image, they are the distance of the subject, the focal length, and the aperture used to capture the photograph. For people using compact digital cameras, one of the subjects of out of the ordinary interest is the depth of field because depth of field is more easily said than done to control with a compact digital camera than with earlier conventional analog film cameras. The minute imaging sensors of compact cameras need the use of short focal lengths, and this in sequence gives these compact digital cameras an extraordinarily long depth of field when compared to other cameras. Thereby, with intent obtaining a shallow depth of field is more complicated.</p>

<p>Considering a general acceptable fact, the depth of field decreases, as the image gets nearer to the camera. This means that as the focal point reaches closer to the lens, the achievable scope of the depth of field ebbs. On the other side, if the image is far enough distant from the camera, and for digital cameras, this must not be very far, the depth of field approaches out to infinity. Another important point to be noted is that the depth of field is proportional to the lens opening.</p>

<p>Having discussed the above important aspects of the light and depth of field of a digital camera, it is clear that the minute details make such great subjects whose knowledge becomes equally important for making appropriate use of the fantastic device, the digital camera! And the digital camera, light and depth of field comes out to be such important factors that can make all the difference if a photographer remains oblivious about this knowledge. A small factor thus can meal a big divergence!</p>
