  </header>

    <p>The most vulnerable time in your life when you are most likely to be a victim of an attack is when you are traveling in an area not very well known to you. Travelers are the focus of many criminals of the world for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Travelers are unarmed and don’t carry weapons. It is illegal to bring many weapons on public transportation such as buses or airplanes. Criminals know this too well and single out the tourist.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Travelers are easy to spot. Travelers have the habit of not blending in with their surroundings. They wear clothes that stand out from the norm. Shorts, for example, when everybody else is wearing long pants. Bright, colorful clothes those look fresh off the rack of the department store. Carrying of a camera around the neck.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Travelers have a false sense of security. When tourists travel abroad to developing countries from a developed world like the U.S., they make the mistake that the country they are visiting is as safe as the country they came from. Upon arrival, then do they realize the danger in the country they are visiting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Travelers flaunt their wealth whether they know it or not. They wear expensive watches, necklaces, and carry large amount of petty cash.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Travelers are perceived to have deep pockets. People in developing countries do not have the luxury of traveling like you do. Therefore, they think that anyone who travels must have money. They often resent those with wealth and will make desperate attempts to take by force from those who have worked hard to afford to travel.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Does that mean that you shouldn’t travel? Of course not. The point is that you must stay out of trouble by not sticking out like a sore thumb.</p>

<p>What should you do to stay safe?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Learn something about the place to where you’re traveling. The more you know about the area your visiting, the more confident you will be when you get there. Buy a map of the area and study it so that you can familiarize yourself with the streets and local landmarks if any. Or look it up on the Internet. Find out as much as you can about the local culture so that you can blend in and not stand out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find out what style of clothing people wear in the country you are visiting. Wear similar clothes to theirs, but don’t wear brand new clothes. That is a definite sign that you MUST have cash on you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Travel in numbers. There is always safety in numbers for tourists. Go with your tour group and stay close as possible. Your tour guide will only take you to places where it is safe for you. Do not wander off from your group.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take a self defense item with you such as a walking stick, or key chain. If you must fly, make sure the self defense weapon is permitted on the plane. Federal law mandates that pepper spray must not be more than 4 oz. if carried by passengers on their person. However, always check with your individual airline because not all airports have the same rules regarding small, personal defense items such as pepper spray or key-chains. In the post 9/11 era, anybody who is perceived as carrying a weapon even if it is pepper spray may be detained, arrested, turned away, or asked to surrender it before flying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not carry large amounts of cash. If you must travel, use credit cards or travelers checks. Those are easily replaceable and traceable if they are stolen and used against you. If you carry a wallet the length of checkbook and carry it in your back pocket, consider putting it in your front pocket so that no one can come up from behind you and remove it. Make it harder for a thief to try to pull a fast one on you. If you must bring cash, put it in your underwear or inside your sock or shoe, but use credit cards or traveler’s checks to make purchases.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep valuables out of sight. Even if you DO travel to a place you think might be safe, do not leave valuables in plain view for others to see. Some low-income people will try to rip you off or even kill you for a measly Rolex, credit card, or petty cash. Your life and your safety are not worth the advertising of your valuables for all to see.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2013/02/25/five-steps-of-creativity/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Five Steps of Creativity</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Why is it that when one mentions the word creativity most people deny that they possess such a trait? Is it because many believe that creativity refers to a person who possesses talent and expresses it in some artistic manner?</p>

<p>You do NOT have to be an artist to be creative. You can express your creativity in any area of life. Creative energy is available to all of us and it does not matter what work you engage in. Creativity is connecting to your soul, the very essence of your being.</p>

<p>“Creative expression lies in all of us and requires a sense of trust and the freedom to allow the flowing for the magic to happen.”</p>

<p>You might be saying, “Joanne, that is easy for you to say being an artist, but I have no creative bone in my body!”</p>

<p>To which I say, “Let’s explore that thought some more.”</p>

<p>Take a serious look at your life up to this point in time. Honestly look at the times when you have experienced and felt joy. What was it you were doing? Now, follow the thread back to its origin the place where this experience of joy was but a fleeting thought or inspiration coming from YOU. Can you see how your actions and the journey that transpired brought you to a deeper connection with your soul?</p>

<p>This connection to your soul, the very essence of your being, is creativity. You express yourself creatively every time you tap into your soul energy. Each time you do this you feel the joy of your willingness, and the more you feel this joy the more you are in tune with the Universe and the Laws of Attraction. You have begun the creative process.</p>

<p>Once started, the flowing of those creative juices continues to enhance your life and you carry the vitality of this energy with you at all times. By staying open to life and its gifts along the way, the next time a fleeting thought or inspiration surfaces you again take action for your creative juices are activated and flowing. You are connected with your soul. You are connected with your creativity.</p>

<p>FIVE STEPS OF CREATIVITY</p>

<p>STEP ONE: Start where you are and accept that you are creative. Trust that this is a journey which will unfold as it is meant to and do NOT rush the process. Be kind to yourself and most of all do not judge, criticize, or compare yourself with others. You are unique. Always honor yourself and your instincts.</p>

<p>STEP TWO: Open yourself to new experiences. Allow that freshness to bathe your soul and awaken areas within you that have been quiet or dormant. There are lessons waiting to be discovered so remain coach-able and teachable. Remember, when the student is ready the teacher will appear.</p>

<p>STEP THREE: Increase your attitude of gratitude and be open to synchronistic events. The higher the vibrational energy you project, the greater your alignment with the Universe and the wealth of your creative journey. Detach yourself from the outcome and trust in the process. Create for the sake of creation and remain in that state.</p>

<p>STEP FOUR: As your creativity brings results, always remain humble for this state will insure that more will follow. Be open to receiving and know that praise and compliments are for the higher Self and not for the ego. Make modifications along the journey as your instinct desires.</p>

<p>STEP FIVE: Always start creative journeys based on service and for the highest good of all. Those who base their creativity on service to others find that emotional vitality is what inspires their creativity. Be sure to give your creativity a place of honor and you may find that even the most mundane tasks turn into creative projects.</p>

<p>MAY YOUR LIFE BE FILLED WITH CREATIVE EXPRESSION</p>

  </header>

    <p>By the years passing medicine discovers many solutions for diseases in our food. Eating diet is considered as one of the main factors of heart disease. If people eat healthy diet, they shall cut a long way to prevent heart disease. However, there are some foods can resolve heart disease problems. This article is noting the advantages of chili and yogurt to control cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>A new study done by U.S researches and was published in the Journal of Food Biochemistry suggested that type two diabetes and high blood pressure could be controlled by eating soy yogurt, and it is better if it included fruit. The study found that soy yogurt and some dairy yogurts may control some enzymes which influence blood sugar levels.</p>

<p>The results found that soy blueberry yogurt powerfully affected three enzymes: angiotensin, alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase. Peach and strawberry yogurt also affected alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase. Researches also found that Plain soy yogurt is the strongest, followed by blueberry dairy yogurt on phenol and antioxidant content. They also found that Soy yogurt is also the best at inhibiting ACE, which causes blood vessels to narrow and raises blood pressure.</p>

<p>Have you ever had a look at heart disease rates among some countries? Around 8 percent of people in America suffer heart disease, however, in India the rates is less than one percent. Scientists referred chili as one of the factors which help decrease the danger of developing heart disease. Indian food is famous with it hot favor, and Indian use chili just like salt in their food (eating too much may cause some side effects).</p>

<p>Chili has so many medical benefits, it starts from influenza to obstinate diseases. Researches found that Cayenne and other red chili peppers can lower cholesterol levels platelet aggregation and triglyceride. It also increases the body’s ability to dissolve fibrin (an important substance to the configuration of blood clots).</p>

<p>Have you seen an obese Indian? For me I have never seen an obese Indian, even rich ones. Chili helps reduces weight. The heat you feel when you eat chili is converted from your body, by burning more calories. In this way chili prevent obesity which is one of the main causes of heart disease.</p>

<p>Beside the advantages of yogurt and chili there are disadvantages of eating too much of them. Just like any food if you eat too much it converts to a cause of a disease. Therefore you must ask your doctor to suggest for you a good and healthy diet to follow.</p>

<p>In conclusion, body’s health in general is a reflection to the person’s diet. If you eat a healthy diet you will have a healthy heart and body, yet you must do some exercises at least two times a weak.</p>

    <p>Using closed end funds for growth and income</p>

<p>If you’re looking for more income, this article could shed some light on the advantages of deeply discounted closed end funds and demonstrated advantages over no-load mutual funds, exchange traded funds (EFT), and loaded mutual funds for income investors. In my over 20 years of investing I’ve constantly seen people make the same mistake of paying too much for their investment. This article is designed to educate on a very unique investment style designed to achieve a greater probability for growth, higher current income, and lower overall risk.</p>

<p>First some basic facts about closed end funds</p>

<p>According to Lee, Shleifer and Thaler (1990) from 1980-1998 the average discount on most US closed end fund varied from 0-20% and averaged around 5%.</p>

<p>According to the Investment Company Institute, at the end of 2005 there were 634 closed-end funds with combined assets of about $276.35 billion.</p>

<p>Many of the same managers of open end funds have loaded and no-load funds along with closed end funds and often have similar investments, risk, and returns.</p>

<p>Closed end funds are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Issued at net asset value (NAV) or above</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On average they trade at a relative discount</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The discount or premium is subject to wide variations over time and across all funds and classes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At termination, the price converges back to NAV</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>How to increase your income</p>

<p>It’s currently trades at a 15.71 % discount and has a 6.64% income from dividends. What this means is that for every $85 dollars invested you will have $100 that’s working for you. At the end of every day the markets calculates the value of the portfolios. For instance, your portfolio is worth 100,000 dollars you could sell it to your spouse or someone else for $85,000 that is what a 15% discount means. Now if that $100,000 portfolio was paying 5.65% or $5,650 dollars per year in income as dividends, then a person now bought it at $85,000 will still receive that same dollar amount or $5,650 income. But since the income from the portfolio is the same and the cost is about $15,000 dollars lower than the new current income is 6.64%. We would like to take you through three simple examples, since the investing family has closed loaded and no load funds. I would make the same assumption on the next three examples that the manager had the same stocks in each structure.</p>

<p>Risks</p>

<p>The only two addition risks that we could identify was that closed end funds have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Higher volatility- meaning the price could go up and down more than traditional mutual funds.</li>
</ol>

<p>2.* Even if purchased at a large discount the discount could become even greater over time.</p>

<p>To Reduce Risk</p>

<p>With an effort to reduce the risks associated with closed ended funds at deep discounts with high income we recommend diversification using many different asset classes and fund families utilizing asset allocation approach. In our growth and income model we use 7 different asset classes to provide a balanced portfolio. This structure was designed to minimize fluctuations. For example, an event that might hurt one class of investments might benefit another. An example of this is after the 9/11 terrorist attack and the 2000 stock market crash. In both cases the stock market had a tremendous sell off, but the high grade bonds had very large rallies. During those two events the stock market and high grade bonds were not correlated. Many experts believe diversifying between asset classes is the single best way to reduce volatility risk</p>

<p>When building portfolio’s we use a selection criteria that focus on: unique asset classes, deep discount , high yield, consistency of payments, ongoing fee’s and other factors we incorporate into the selection are, past track record of the fund, and past track record of the management team, and of course the management team. We apply our selection criteria to over 600 closed ended funds with a goal to find only 1 or 2 in each asset class that fits our needs.</p>

<p>Simply don’t put all your eggs in one basket. If the assets classes are non-correlated then this reduces the portfolio risk.</p>

<p>How to Increase your Principle</p>

<p>Now performance here is what the USA Today said about discounted closed end funds “If you’re patient, buying funds at a steep discount can be extremely lucrative? For example, suppose you divided the closed-end universe into fifths, starting with the most expensive. The priciest 20 percent gained 48 percent in the past five years. The 20 percent with the steepest discounts, however, soared 160 percent.”</p>

<p>According to USA today the returns for largest discounted closed end fund beat the premium funds by 300%</p>

<p>Common Sense</p>

<p>It just makes good common sense. The less you pay for an investment the higher the probability of getting a better return. Finding an investment at a 10-20% discount for similar portfolio’s that others are paying a premium is very basic to investing. The next time someone is selling you a ETF or a mutual fund with a 5% load just for income just remember this paper because you might be able to find a similar portfolio from the same managers in a closed end fund with 10-20% cheaper plus receive about a 10-20% higher current income.</p>

<p>If you invest in a deep discount closed end fund with high income you receive more invested principle for less money.</p>

  </header>

    <p>For a marketing plan to succeed, your marketing material needs to appeal to your potential buyer and capture his attention straight away.</p>

<p>If you fail to attract his attention, you could be driving away potential customers who could benefit by buying your products or services.</p>

<p>Before you start creating your marketing materials, you need to know what turns potential customers off as well as knowing how to create a message which will turn them into buyers.</p>

<p>Whether it be your brochure, your newsletter, or even your web site, people do not want to read about you and how clever you are. What they want to know is what you can do for them to make their life easier. So forget about self-promotion and focus on what is important to your potential customer.</p>

<p>Power words to use in your copy include new and free, how-to, now, announcing, introducing, powerful, bargain and hurry. Although they may seem old and over-used, they still work.</p>

<p>Action words such as live, move, play etc also appeal and get people excited enough to want to buy what you are offering.</p>

<p>Some words are better than others at grabbing attention and they include learn which suggests knowledge, discover which suggests excitement, savings because everyone wants to save money and time and proven which creates peace of mind.</p>

<p>If your message is totally ‘hard sell,’ you will put off your prospective buyer. Focus on providing value for money and always deliver what you offer or even more.</p>

<p>Look for a new or fresh idea about your product or service so your message is not exactly the same as what you have promoted before.</p>

<p>Ensure your message appeals to a person’s emotions so you focus on what your product or service can do to improve the quality of life of the potential buyer. So a copywriter should not focus on the brilliant copy he can create, but on how much more money and free time his client will have by using him to write his marketing materials.</p>

<p>Your customers want to know that you can be trusted to deliver as promised so give them a brief idea of who you are and what it is that makes your product or service better than any other.</p>

<p>People will buy if they think the cost of the item is worth the money. If you charge more for small extras, you will send buyers away but if you over deliver by adding extra value, people will usually respond accordingly.</p>

<p>If you portray the image of knowing what you are about, you instill confidence in people and they will respond by buying from you. Your image should come through in all of your marketing materials and by doing so you will be seen as someone who is honest and confident and who can be trusted.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Niagara Falls seems to be the Canadian attraction and one of the most notorious waterfalls on the Earth. Canada receives more than 20 millions of tourists annually and the most of them get to Niagara Falls. The profits for Canada are really huge!</p>

<p>Niagara river connects two of the Great Lakes – Ontario and Eri and is a part of the border between Canada and USA. The waterfall is situated approximately in the middle of the river.</p>

<p>Waterfall consists of two parts – the American and the Canadian. They are separated by the Goat Island. Canadian part is more known. It is 792 wide and about 50 meters high. American part is much more narrow – about 300 meters. The height is approximately the same.</p>

<p>This natural miracle looks beautiful at any time of the year, but please remember, that Canadian winters are rather cold! If you are not afraid of the frost, you will have a delightful opportunity to contemplate stark waterfall in all its magnificence.</p>

<p>In spring it becomes colored with tulips and daffodils. In summer when it’s warm and sunny you often can watch a rainbow above waterfall.</p>

<p>One of the most exciting experiences is the trip to waterfall on the boat. It’s necessary to wear a raincoat because you get wet anyway.</p>

<p>Another way to get strong impressions is the Journey Behind the Falls. Lift takes you to three tunnels from where opens a breathtaking view to waterfalls. You can also admire Niagara from the air in helicopter.</p>

<p>Some prefer to enjoy a spectacular view of Niagara from the bridges – Rainbow Bridge is the most popular one.</p>

<p>The nearest big cities are Buffalo in USA and Toronto in Canada, but there is a city Niagara Falls just by the waterfall.</p>

<p>Attractions include Queen Victoria Park, adjacent to the Canadian Falls; the historical museum at Lundy’s Lane, site of a brutal battle between American and British forces in 1814; Skylon Tower and Pavilion, containing a revolving restaurant and an observation deck overlooking the falls; and of course, Casino Niagara.</p>

<p>Above the waterfall itself the place also boasts rich fauna. Niagara shores are inhabited by 19 kinds of gulls. Niagara Parks Butterfly Conservatory is a home for 50 kinds of butterflies from all over the world.</p>
