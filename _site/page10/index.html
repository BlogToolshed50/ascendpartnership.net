  </header>

    <p>You don’t know what it is like to taste a pineapple until you’ve eaten one, even if you know its physical features and the processes that happen in a human being once he or she tastes a pineapple. Does it mean that the mind is physical?</p>

<p>In this essay I shall attempt to show that you cannot know what it is like to taste a pineapple unless you have tasted it, even if you knew everything physical that happened to a person when they taste Pineapple according to modern day physics. I will then discuss the implications of this as to whether the mind is physical.</p>

<p>To begin with, I shall explain what I mean by knowledge. In this case I shall be using Descartes condition that if something is clearly and distinctly perceived, we can say to have knowledge of it. I shall however be going further by assuming that there is also an external world. This seems to me to be clearly and distinctly perceived, and is also verifiable by other people. Therefore we can claim to be able to know everything physical about what happens to a person when they taste something. We could observe all their bodily functions, specifically, the molecules of pineapple causing taste buds on the tongue to send messages to the brain via the nervous system, and certain fibers in the brain firing. We would be able to observe this with our own eyes and through the use of various medical apparatus, and would also be available for other people to observe and report the same observation. We may not know the true underlying nature of the observed, but would have knowledge of the sense data caused by these physical processes.</p>

<p>However, surely this would not be knowledge of what pineapple actually tastes like. By observing the physical processes occurring in the body we may be aware of the various patterns of electrical current interacting in the nervous system and brain, but not of the experience or “qualia” which a person has when they taste pineapple. This is because these qualia are only experienced by the person doing the tasting. To make this clearer I have devised an argument to show that the opposite is false.</p>

<p>Premise 1: All physical processes of a body are publicly observable</p>

<p>Premise 2: Person A observes all physical processes of person B who is tasting a pineapple</p>

<p>Conclusion 1: Person A has Knowledge of all physical processes occurring in Person B’s body whilst tasting a pineapple</p>

<p>Conclusion 2: Person A has knowledge of qualia experienced by person B.</p>

<p>For this argument to be valid there would have to be another premise in between the first and second conclusion. This would be that knowledge of all physical processes occurring in person B whilst tasting pineapple is also knowledge of the taste or qualia of pineapple. However it seems clear to me that this premise is not true. Never in my experience have I observed someone eating pineapple and thereby experienced the taste qualities myself. Admittedly I have not observed the nerves in the tongue sending nerve impulses to the brain and the brain thereby reacting, but I am aware that neuro scientists have done so and not managed to experience another persons qualia. It seems therefore that the only way we can know what it is like to taste pineapple is to taste it ourselves.</p>

  </header>

    <p>When it comes to family, there are few things in life that are more important. And if you’ve ever wondered who your ancestors were, then you’re certainly not alone! No matter how big or small your family is, finding out about your past ancestors is not only a fascinating business but could also be crucial to helping you understand yourself as a person.</p>

<p>In fact, genealogy has taken off in Britain in recent years, particularly as recent legislation has helped in the release of census documents from hundreds of years ago. Programs like the BBC’s ‘Who Do You Think You Are?’ have popularized the importance of finding out your family history, with famous TV stars and personalities – including Barbara Windsor, Jeremy Paxman and David Tennant, among others – all portraying their search for their ancestors.</p>

<p>In today’s world, where people are perpetually online, there are hundreds of websites that allow you to search for your family history. Genealogy search is becoming ever-more important as more and more look towards their past to find answers for the present and the future. If you’re a novice at family tree research, then it’s important to explore a variety of family search tools in order to familiarize yourself with techniques and tips that will help you find what you’re looking for.</p>

<p>For instance, if you’re looking for an ancestor that was born prior to 1875, bear in mind that an estimated 6 to 10 per cent of births were not registered in this period and it was only in 1875 that compulsory registration of both births and deaths was implemented. What’s more, searching for births, deaths and marriages further back than this proves even more difficult, since the introduction of General Civil Registration of Births, Marriages and Deaths only occurred in 1837 in England and Wales.</p>

<p>Novice genealogy searchers, however, should also bear in mind census inaccuracies when trying to compile their family trees. Census records are an invaluable resource for people who are tracing their family history; in fact, census returns are crucial because they can not only tell people who their ancestors were and what they did, but also where they lived and whether or not they had brothers and sisters. This can help reunite families as people exploring their family past may discover they have uncles, aunts or cousins they didn’t know existed.</p>

<p>Many websites and resources that allow people to make genealogy searches will offer excellent tips and techniques in order for you to make the most effective search for your family tree. So, wherever you choose to search for your ancestors, you can rest assured you’ll find something that will afford you a glimpse into your family past!</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2013/08/14/abstract-art-ideas/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Abstract Art Ideas</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>To have a basic and fundamental look at the subject, we should first understand what the word abstract means before we could tackle the understanding of “abstract art” itself; and we learn that abstract in this sense and as a verb means to extract or remove and surprisingly as an adjective means not easy to understand; abstruse. And as a transitive verb it means to take away, remove. It’s origin is from Latin abstrahere ‘draw away’ or ‘draw from.’</p>

<p>Aesthetics as a set of principles and branch of philosophy deals with questions concerning beauty and artistic experiences. As far as our general understanding of it is concerned it is a highly nebulous field, subjected to tremendous degree of misinterpretation, particularly in the field of abstract art. In any field of humanities where less accurately is known about that field and its principles have not been precisely formulated, the more authoritarian the field becomes. In the field of arts, with no exact fundamentals accurately developed, the techniques and approaches are wide open for the artists to imagine, explore and create their art.</p>

<p>Later artists took up the movement in such a way that abstract painting gained much importance. The artists believed that the job of the artists was to deepen the mystery rather than revealing it. In abstraction only conception made a difference. The basic idea behind the idea remains the same. Stephen Wright once commented on abstract painting that he had been doing a lot of abstract painting without paint, brush and canvas, but just by thinking about it.</p>

<p>By changed interpretation of reality, it can range from just a small change where the color of the sky is changed from the actual light blue to say a green or can be a completely different interpretation of reality such as a cubist painting by Picasso, where he completely rearranges and drastically changes a woman’s face. Both can be called abstract, though the first one is clearly very much realism and very little abstraction-ism, whereas the second one is very little realism and very much abstraction-ism.</p>

<p>We would have to guess, that, if she, and the abstract art market, do not fall into harm, then, in that case, she will be big league ere long, so it is a “hurry up” matter, to get her stuff, while it is still cheap, if you are an investor. Probably her stuff is a good investment, and will rise in value. Brittany works in abstract water color paintings, abstract art prints, abstract art books, and, abstract art gouache paintings.</p>

<p>Abstract art is an artist’s impression of a subject or feeling rather than an exact likeness. If you want a flower that looks like a flower or a house that looks like a house, then abstract art is probably not for you. Abstract art is all about expression of feelings, moods, and perceptions through colors and/or different shapes. Some works of abstract art are very intricate and detailed while others are quite simple.</p>

<p>In the Twentieth Century, several other movements such as, Fauvism &amp; Cubism contributed in breaking new grounds. Fauvist used colors in non-realist ways and Cubism brought in the idea of painting an object from more than one standpoint. In addition, Abstract Expressionism, which surfaced in the 1940s, is all about spontaneous, automatic, or subconscious creation. In Abstract Art, the artists express themselves through an aggregation of the emotional strength and self-denial. This expression is coupled with the anti-figurative feels of the European Abstract Doctrine, specified as Futurism, the Bauhaus, and Synthetic Cubism.</p>

  </header>

    <p>As we all aware of, the body is in need of protein food to repair and build the body muscle., but scientists caution that excessive protein food can build up the ketones and drive the kidneys to overwork to flush them out, which is not good for health. As a result of too much consumption of protein food, one can lose significant amount of water from the body leading to the weakness and dizziness. One may undergo loss of hair, low appetite and even breath due to the excessive intake of the protein rich food. The kidney gets strained due to overwork to combat the ill effect of taking more protein food than what are needed.</p>

<p>If any one is fond of crossing the limit of protein foods, they are bounds to add more fat in the system since the excess protein is converted to fat by the system in the words of Dr. Tickoo, consultant in international medicine, the body converts the protein’s nitrogen in to uric acid which in large quantity affects the kidney and results in the formation of kidney stones. The body is capable of processing about four to five grams of protein per hour. If you are taking a protein shake and bar it may take about 10 hours to digest and absorb. Such instant shakes also makes you miss the vitamins and nutrients one is able to get from the real food. Too much protein can also lead to the risk of getting haemorrhoid, polyps and colon cancer. An amount of 50 to 70 gm of protein is found to be sufficient per day to maintain the health.</p>

  </header>

    <p>In the recent days we come across a lot of news on the bad debts in the banking industry that is normally called as the Non Performing Loans. When the economy is not assisting the growth of the business, the failure to repay the loan availed is on the increase. Many defaults that are happening in the agriculture sector is due to failure of the crop and the UN remunerative price offered to the agriculturists.</p>

<p>As a whole the banking industry in various countries suffer due to this issue and there are instances that the banks file bankruptcy due to the negative net worth. Though the banks are meticulously follow the systems to deliver the loans there are occasions that they fail in their judgment and the loan becomes bad.</p>

<p>The banks devise various methods to recover the loan once it becomes non performing as they have to suffer loss. The banks resort to the legal means also at times to recover the dues from the intentional defaulters who are having sufficient means to repay the loan. Despite all the positive efforts, they have to face the issue of non performing assets in their portfolio due to govt policies as well.</p>

<p>It is high time that stringent norms are put in place while extending the loan to the borrowers and timely recovery is made. If you observe the recent set back in the USA, many banks were closed putting the taxpayers money at stake. As an individual one must prove to be a responsible citizen to maintain the health of the banking system by prompt repayment.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Toddlers are learning to walk, learning to run, and exploring their world in full force with all five senses. Toys that stimulate their curiosity and aid in their development are the best choices at this age. Toddlers have graduated from their baby toys, needing traditional toys that encourage more manipulation with fingers and hands and toys that develop large muscles, but they have not yet developed all the skills needed to play with preschool traditional toys. There are a wide selection of toys available that are designed just for the toddler age and offer lots of opportunities for development and learning.</p>

<p>Push and pull toys are often favorites of toddlers. Push toys allow toddlers to practice walking and are great for balancing during the first steps, while pull toys are best for those who are already walking to gain more of a mastery of balance and coordination. Push and pull toys that create sounds or lights with movement are especially delightful to toddlers.</p>

<p>Blocks and stacking toys are also appropriate toddler traditional toys. Look for blocks that are too large to fit inside a child’s mouth with simple, easy to manipulate shapes. Stacking toys that encourage size discrimination are excellent for enhancing cognitive development and logical thinking.</p>

<p>Foot powered ride on toys are enjoyed by most toddlers. These scooter styled ride ons develop large muscles used to walk, run, and jump, and are available in many designs to spur imaginative play and creativity. Many ride on toys are available in convertible models that include a detachable handle for an adult pushed ride until the toddler is ready to power herself.</p>

<p>Simple puzzles and activity toys are ideal choices for educational traditional toys. Wooden puzzles with one large piece or no more than five big pieces are easy for toddlers to manipulate. Toys with buttons and knobs that cause noises, lights, or things to pop up are perfect for developing problem solving skills, as well as fine motor.</p>

<p>Books are good, quality traditional toys at any age. Toddlers will do best with thick, chunky board books. These books are designed for young children that may rip pages or chew corners. Board books typically have lots of colorful pictures that attract the attention of toddlers. They are great to read aloud at story time or for toddlers to explore on their own.</p>

<p>Soft dolls without loose hair and stuffed animals are toys that many toddlers cherish into their preschool years. Look for stuffed toys that feature painted or sewn facial features to avoid choking hazards. Encourage your toddler to engage in pretend play by providing baby blankets and toy doll furniture as props for playtime.</p>

<p>Toddlers are developing large muscle skills at a very rapid rate. Encourage this development with soft, squishy balls to roll, bounce, toss, and kick. Beanbags are also great toys to develop arm muscles as well as hand and eye coordination.</p>

<p>The best traditional toys for toddlers are those that are simple to use, yet invites the child to think and explore various outcomes. Toddler toys should stimulate their natural curiosity and lead them to discover new skills. Traditional toys that exercise large motor skills are also ideal for toddlers.</p>

    <p>Go against the grain!</p>

<p>When you arrive at 50, those around you will expect you to slow down and retire. They will ask what you are planning to do when you stop working. The marketing messages you see are pushing youth and beauty and the pursuit of material goods. You suddenly realize you don’t have an answer or a plan for what you will do. So instead you work harder, but it’s the same career you’ve been working in for many years—and you never really enjoyed it in the first place.</p>

<p>This is when you realize that you don’t have the energy or passion for THIS work any longer!</p>

<p>What can you do?</p>

<p>This is the hard part. Your friends and family have come to expect nothing different from you. You have defined yourself by your work. This is the image you project to others. Your work has paid the bills over the years, provided for a few fun material goods, and your family never complained.</p>

<p>But inside you, something—suddenly—is seriously wrong. You know and you feel it.</p>

<p>I am going to die soon if I continue this work…</p>

<p>At least that’s how it feels. You feel trapped, bored, and worse—empty of purpose or passion. You read stories about—and admire—others at 50 who have given up their banking and teaching jobs to suddenly move to an outpost in South America, or open an orphanage in Africa.</p>

<p>You wish you had the courage to follow your own passion, or at least figure out what it is.</p>

<p>Crises all around you</p>

<p>You start to notice that people your age are dying around you.</p>

<p>Your friend from college—the successful one—suddenly has a heart attack and dies, leaving his family behind. A person you work with is diagnosed with cancer. Your neighbor gets into a car accident and is unable to walk again. These things make you nervous.</p>

<p>You feel lucky that you are healthy; no crises yet.</p>

<p>Then your crisis hits…</p>

<p>…and it will. Perhaps one day you come home and your spouse of 20 years tells you he is not happy any more and wants out. Or you are laid off without notice or severance. Maybe you hurt your back, and now you can only work part-time.</p>

<p>Perhaps you crisis is a small one, but it feels just as large as those on this list.</p>

<p>You are tired of your boss reminding you of your mistakes, and the silly dress-down days at work make you ill—you just can’t bear the news of another mandatory office birthday celebration.</p>

<p>You feel trapped</p>

<p>You suddenly feel like you have died. What is left in life?</p>

<p>Each day seems like the last, and you suddenly feel like you are not contributing to anything that seems important or worthwhile.</p>

<p>At 50, life changes</p>

<p>In mid-life, and especially around 50, it is normal to start to feel a little hopeless about your life. While the messages around you suggest retirement, followed by death, you actually feel differently.</p>

<p>Deep inside, you feel 25 again. You know you still have the energy for something more if only you could figure this out. You still feel attractive, and actually a little sexy, although you would hardly broadcast this to others.</p>

<p>The problem is, of course, that there doesn’t seem—at 50—to be an outlet for all this youthful passion. All your friends are continuing their normal routines, and talking of retirement.</p>

<p>You think to yourself, retirement? I haven’t even started to live yet.</p>

<p>Make your crisis a crusade</p>

<p>There is a way out of your lackluster life.</p>

<p>It takes new choices, and a new purpose.</p>

<p>Can you start to live like you are dying? In other words, if today was your last, what would you do over and over again? What would you do if you had lots of courage and nothing to lose?</p>

<p>So many people live their life in protection mode; that is, they are seeking to avoid risk. They don’t make a move without first consulting their attorney, their financial adviser, and their CPA.</p>

<p>The problem with this strategy is no one else can throw the blankets off the passion and purpose in your heart. This must come from you.</p>

<p>I know from experience.</p>

<p>Growing up an only child, I saw my own mother work for years at jobs she hated, hoping to get lucky and meet the person who would take care of her.</p>

<p>At only 57 years of age, my mom died—broke and unhappy—and still looking for someone else to take care of her. I was with her when she asked me for that last gulp of juice as the cancer defeated her—at 65 pounds she had just enough strength to try to throw the covers off in one last effort to get out of bed. I told her to lie still, worried she might hurt herself.</p>

<p>I realized later that this was her effort to live.</p>

<p>But it was too late for her.</p>

<p>Are you struggling to uncover your passion and purpose in life?</p>

<p>Your 50s are your time to celebrate, to laugh too much, and to be overly optimistic. This is your time to quit your job, and find vocational passion.</p>

<p>This is your time to gather internal courage, stop asking others for permission, and start to live with an internal road map—not an external one.</p>

<p>I can’t promise you that the crisis won’t hit, but if it does, your life’s work will provide the protection you will need.</p>

<p>Start your journey now</p>

<p>You are young; you have energy; you can be happy!</p>

<p>What kind of work best aligns your interests and your passion right now in your life?</p>

<p>What kind of work calls you now? What is the right work for you now, and why?</p>

<p>How can you gather up the support you will need for the next stage of this journey called your life?</p>

<p>Celebrate</p>

<p>Celebrate your life. Today is the first day for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>The actions you take now will set you up for happiness and fulfillment for the next 30 years or more, and that’s a long time.</p>

<p>So look in the mirror today, and smile. See how great and sexy and alive you look. Start to appreciate yourself, and feel new purpose and excitement as you begin your own journey toward vocational passion.</p>

<p>Teach in China, join a non-profit, or contribute to healthy living, or …</p>

<p>What matters most is that you don’t buy into the messages around you—you don’t have to slow down and move aside.</p>

<p>This is your time, baby! Let loose, and show others what it means to live with purpose and passion!</p>

<p>As always, I’ll be cheering you on as you go.</p>
