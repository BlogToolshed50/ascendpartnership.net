  </header>

    <p>As time evolves, web design as well, must do the same. It is the duty of web designers to discover what’s ‘hot’ in web design and forget those which are already cliche to the industry.</p>

<p>Web design is an artsy interface. It is all about blending, harmony, unity and functionality. Its beauty and usability combined. Given is the fact that each web designer has his own style of making his design communicate. It varies according to the art influences that they have, their preferences and the stuffs that they want to incorporate in a certain design.</p>

<p>Time is one great influence. As we move forward, we are discovering lots of things to make our design better and more effective. Two of the new designs invading the internet nowadays are the design with the use of 3D objects and robots. This design is made possible by the use of 3D software, production technologies and other sophisticated materials.</p>

<p>When it comes to 3D objects, a simple spreadsheet can edit the same. Anyone skilled in the matter can control the object’s champers, fillets, dimensions, shell thickness and more. After that is to go into details. Even the minutest style element detail must be given a leeway and must be considered so as to yield a productive output.</p>

<p>3D software allows the designer to edit the image continuously. The style tools are just around the interface for easy access. This access can speed up the design process of the object. It can be edited and refined in an easy manner.</p>

<p>The evolution of these 3D tools will give a wider leeway to all the designers. As a result, design will be enhanced so as to make it catchier.</p>

<p>Another worthy discovery is the use of robots on the website. Robots can be easily downloaded. There are numbers of sites that are offering them. Through robots, you can give ample information. They are recorded so that the moment the viewers set their eyes on your site, they immediately hear the information. No need to scroll, no need to type. The information is readily made available to them.</p>

<p>These additions will surely uplift the web design’s aesthetic and functionalism aspects. More discoveries are yet to come.</p>

    <p>After making a list of fascinatingly simple and moving short films, including Color Blind, Shervin Youssefian explodes onto the Hollywood scene with this superb low-budget that combines film noir with comedy with thriller and manages to still come out as a believable contemporary work of art. The film weaves in and out at a lighting pace and you’re out of the theater before you can release your breath. “The film was packed with twists and humor and it felt more like a 30 minute film because of its pace than the hour and a half film that it is,” says Alberto Finna, one of the enthusiastic viewers at a test screening.</p>

<p>Machiavelli Hangman had been buzzing around the internet circuit as the to-beat film of 2006 despite its incredible low-budget of 150k. In a year that produced such major studio films like Batman Begins, War of the Worlds and later Superman Returns, it is refreshing to see that there are smaller films that get some breathing time.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, Machiavelli Hangman is very much like the popular Crash that starred a list of A-listers like Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle and Matt Dillan. These types of films that tell multiple stories at once and let the audience focus on more than one subplot are becoming increasingly popular because of their interactive value. “Finally, Hollywood is starting to produce films that have something to say and leave a lot of it for us to interpret,” adds Finna.</p>

<p>Memento surprised many studio executives who had doubts about its performance at the box-office when it gained momentum and was head to head with the bigger honchos that year. The doubts were understandable about Christopher Nolan’s art house film because Memento doesn’t have the conventional narrative style as most films. The editor of the film who was later that year nominated for an Oscar chose to present the film backwards. This was a technique that was never attempted before, out of fear of losing the audience’s attention.</p>

<p>Another art house film that enjoyed much success with audiences domestically and abroad was David Lynch’s much acclaimed Mulholland Dr. that many believe is a twisted adaptation of Dismay’s Alice in Wonderland. The film won Lynch a Director’s Award at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for screenwriting.</p>

<p>Modern filmmakers seem to be catching on to the trend and they are offering more material to think about to the audience, instead of simply chewing the information and feeding it to the moviegoers. Audiences are getting smarter and the films have to keep up.</p>

  </header>

    <p>We remember our Mother on Mother’s Day. That is not to say that otherwise we have forgotten her. But on Mother’s Day, we especially say thanks to our mother. This is the day to celebrate Motherhood. Let us talk about our mother and find out if one day in a year is enough to remember mother?</p>

<p>We are grown up today because of our mother. Right from the day we are born, mother takes us under her protection. She feeds us, gives us medicines, looks after our growth and teaches us to walk and play. Mother helps us in our school studies and fights for us with others if required. Mother saves us from every calamity. Watch a toddler in lap of her mother and you will see a deep sense of peace on his/her face. A child feels totally safe when he/she knows that mother is nearby.</p>

<p>We thank our friends, our co-workers and every body who helps us. What about our mother? When shall we thank her for bringing us up? When shall we thank her for the sleepless nights she had because of us/ when shall we thank her for cleaning us during our infancy? When shall we thank her for giving us birth?</p>

<p>A mother deserves much more than a single Mother’s day. She should know that we realize what all she did for us and are thankful for that. No thank can ever repay mother’s debt, but at least we will make her happy.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2012/06/11/personal-qualities-found-in-a-good-leader/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Personal Qualities Found In A Good Leader</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>How often have you heard the comment, “He or she is a born leader?” There are certain characteristics found in some people that seem to naturally put them in a position where they’re looked up to as a leader.</p>

<p>Whether in fact a person is born a leader or develops skills and abilities to become a leader is open for debate. There are some clear characteristics that are found in good leaders. These qualities can be developed or may be naturally part of their personality. Let us explore them further.</p>

<p>Seven Personal Qualities Found In A Good Leader</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A good leader has an exemplary character. It is of utmost importance that a leader is trustworthy to lead others. A leader needs to be trusted and be known to live their life with honestly and integrity. A good leader “walks the talk” and in doing so earns the right to have responsibility for others. True authority is born from respect for the good character and trustworthiness of the person who leads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A good leader is enthusiastic about their work or cause and also about their role as leader. People will respond more openly to a person of passion and dedication. Leaders need to be able to be a source of inspiration, and be a motivator towards the required action or cause. Although the responsibilities and roles of a leader may be different, the leader needs to be seen to be part of the team working towards the goal. This kind of leader will not be afraid to roll up their sleeves and get dirty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A good leader is confident. In order to lead and set direction a leader needs to appear confident as a person and in the leadership role. Such a person inspires confidence in others and draws out the trust and best efforts of the team to complete the task well. A leader who conveys confidence towards the proposed objective inspires the best effort from team members.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A leader also needs to function in an orderly and purposeful manner in situations of uncertainty. People look to the leader during times of uncertainty and unfamiliarity and find reassurance and security when the leader portrays confidence and a positive demeanor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Good leaders are tolerant of ambiguity and remain calm, composed and steadfast to the main purpose. Storms, emotions, and crises come and go and a good leader takes these as part of the journey and keeps a cool head.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A good leader as well as keeping the main goal in focus is able to think analytically. Not only does a good leader view a situation as a whole, but is able to break it down into sub parts for closer inspection. Not only is the goal in view but a good leader can break it down into manageable steps and make progress towards it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A good leader is committed to excellence. Second best does not lead to success. The good leader not only maintains high standards, but also is proactive in raising the bar in order to achieve excellence in all areas.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These seven personal characteristics are foundational to good leadership. Some characteristics may be more naturally present in the personality of a leader. However, each of these characteristics can also be developed and strengthened. A good leader whether they naturally possess these qualities or not, will be diligent to consistently develop and strengthen them in their leadership role.</p>

    <p>Tsunamis cannot be prevented or precisely predicted</p>

<p>1.Regions with a high risk of tsunamis may use tsunami warning systems to detect tsunamis and warn the general population before the wave reaches land.</p>

<p>2.Computer models can roughly predict tsunami arrival and impact based on information about the event that triggered it and the shape of the seafloor and coastal land.</p>

<p>3.the early warnings comes from nearby animals.</p>

<p>4.building tsunami walls of up to 4.5 m (13.5 ft) high in front of populated coastal areas.</p>

<p>5.floodgates and channels to redirect the water from incoming tsunamis.</p>

<p>6.Environmentalists have suggested tree planting along stretches of sea coast which are prone to tsunami risks, it would take some years for the trees to grow to a useful size. And such plantations could offer a much cheaper and longer-lasting means of tsunami mitigation.</p>
